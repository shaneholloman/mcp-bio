# Contributing to BioMCP

BioMCP does not accept outside pull requests.

We do welcome:

- GitHub Issues for bugs, regressions, and reproducible problems
- GitHub Discussions for feature ideas, usage questions, and documentation requests

This policy keeps release provenance, supply-chain control, and copyright review
for AI-assisted code with the core maintainers. We still want problem reports
and product feedback, and the team will fix confirmed issues in the main repo.

When you open an issue or discussion, include:

- the BioMCP version
- the command you ran
- the relevant output or error text
- any source or API context needed to reproduce the problem

## Repo-Local Test Setup

Install `cargo-nextest` before running repo-local Rust verification:

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
```

`make test` uses `cargo nextest run` plus the Python/docs contract lane.
`make lint` runs the repo lint script and the quality ratchet. `make spec` is
the offline deterministic routine executable-spec gate. `make spec-contracts`
is a deterministic legacy subset kept for profile compatibility. `make verify`
is the explicit opt-in live public-upstream confidence lane; `make
release-live-smoke` remains a compatibility alias. `make spec-pr` remains
available for the same offline `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS` as `make spec`, through
`scripts/run-specs.sh`: routine specs are Markdown-only and use `mustmatch test
--lang bash`. Static Python surface contracts live under `tests/surface/` and
run through `make test`. The executable docs themselves call
`tools/biomcp-ci`, which owns release-binary resolution, the repo-owned
`.cache/biomcp-specs/` cache/XDG roots, optional-key stripping, and warm-hit
`BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` replay when CI sets `BIOMCP_SPEC_CACHE_HIT=1`.
Use `make lint`, `make test`, and `make spec` as the canonical local gates;
there is no supported `make check` command. `make release-gate` is the single
routine release-readiness command; it runs `lint test spec` directly. Use
`make test-contracts` to rerun just the release-critical Python/docs lane.

### Local Pre-Commit Hook

Developers who opt in to the repo-local pre-commit hook should install it at
`$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks/pre-commit)`. The hook is local Git state;
the repo does not install it automatically.

Use this shape so `scripts/pre-commit-reject-march-artifacts.sh` runs before
`cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --lib --tests -- -D warnings`:

```bash
hook_path="$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks/pre-commit)"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$hook_path")"
cat >"$hook_path" <<'HOOK'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
cd "$ROOT"

scripts/pre-commit-reject-march-artifacts.sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --lib --tests -- -D warnings
HOOK
chmod +x "$hook_path"
```

The helper allows only `.march/code-review-log.md` and
`.march/validation-profiles.toml` under `.march/`, and it permits staged
deletions so cleanup commits can remove old March artifacts from tracking.

### Timing Method

Measured on beelink on 2026-04-23 with `/usr/bin/time -p` using warm-cache
steady-state runs. Each command was run once untimed to warm build artifacts and
the repo-owned spec cache under `.cache/biomcp-specs/`, then once with timing
enabled. The `make spec-pr` row was refreshed on 2026-04-24 after the spec-v2
canary cutover. `make release-gate` composes `lint test spec` directly, so its
warm timing tracks the current sum of those warmed routine component lanes.

| Command | Observed warm-cache | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `make lint` | refresh pending | includes the quality ratchet |
| `make test` | refresh pending | Rust nextest plus Python/docs contract lane |
| `make spec-contracts` | `337.47s` | Markdown-only deterministic subset, including local MCP proof (2026-06-17; ticket 427) |
| `make spec` / `make spec-pr` | refresh pending | Markdown-only offline deterministic routine spec lane after ticket 427 |
| `make verify` | `operator-run` | opt-in live public-upstream smoke; not part of routine gates |
| `make release-gate` | refresh pending | lint + test + spec routine gate |
