"""Landed tickets must record their review verdicts in one Review
grammar, and no tracked file may carry merge-conflict markers.

The review rules catch the class Ian's 2026-09-26 review found (six
landed tickets still said a review was pending) and the shapes the
2026-09-27 review showed still leaked (wrapped text, bold bullets,
any scope containing "batch", a REJECT with no later ACCEPT, and
tickets without records skipped entirely). Structure, not phrase
bans:

* Logical lines: a Review bullet and its indented continuations join
  into one line before matching, so no wrapped spelling passes.
* One grammar: ``- <Kind>[(<scope>)]: <verdict>`` where Kind is one
  of the six house kinds. Any line that looks review-ish but does not
  parse is a format failure — bold, starred, or misspelled kinds all
  land here.
* Resolution: a verdict's state is read from its state tokens
  (ACCEPT, REJECT, BLOCK, pending). A pending token in a landed
  ticket fails unless its scope is a genuinely open slice (no other
  line gives that same kind+scope a verdict). A REJECT or BLOCK
  requires a later ACCEPT for the same kind, or its own line must
  name what resolved it (fixed/folded/verified/superseded/accepted).
* Coverage: every ticket file is scanned. Legacy tickets without
  records keep honest pending lines only while their work is unlanded;
  the 2026-09-27 backfill gave the landed legacy tickets their honest
  "record not kept at the time" verdicts.

The second rule catches what merge 7206240b shipped: conflict markers
committed to main. Scanning happens against `git ls-files`, so the
check fails the suite before a bisect ever lands on the broken commit.
