"""GWAS keeps NoStore unconditionally (ticket 1268).

`BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` once replaced GWAS's no-store mark with
force-cache and served stale bodies — the decode-failure class the
bypass exists to prevent. The invariant is structural: GWAS sends
every request through `request_no_store`, sets `CacheMode::NoStore`
there, and never calls `apply_cache_mode`. reqwest hides request
extensions outside its crate, so the pin lives here at the source
shape, like the external-XML guard.
