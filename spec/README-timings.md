# Spec Lane Audit

## Spec Lane Split

| Lane | Make target | Run when | Timeout | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `spec-pr` | `make spec-pr` | every PR and repo-local pre-merge verification | `60s` per heading | Stable PR-blocking live specs after `SPEC_PR_DESELECT_ARGS` exclusions |
| `spec-smoke` | `make spec-smoke` | targeted local smoke rerun for ticket-270 volatile headings | `120s` per heading | Exactly the eight ticket-270 live-network headings represented by `SPEC_SMOKE_ARGS` |
| `spec` | `make spec` | scheduled full smoke workflow and manual full smoke reruns | `120s` per heading | Full live spec suite, including every smoke-only heading |
| `test-contracts` | `make test-contracts` | PR contracts lane and local docs/Python validation | n/a | Rust release build plus Python/docs contract checks |

`spec-pr` is the fast blocking lane, `spec-smoke` is the serial local rerun for the eight ticket-270 live-network headings, `spec` remains the full live suite used by the existing scheduled smoke workflow, and `test-contracts` covers the Python/docs contract surface. Use this file as the current audit and smoke-only inventory for `SPEC_PR_DESELECT_ARGS`.

## Bash Mustmatch Lint Rule

Every `##` spec section with at least one non-skipped `bash` block must include
at least one `| mustmatch` line unless the section explicitly opts out with
`<!-- mustmatch-lint: skip -->`.

This rule exists because the mustmatch pytest plugin silently does not collect
bash blocks that never pipe to `mustmatch`. A section that only uses `jq -e` or
other exit-code checks can disappear from pytest output instead of passing,
failing, or skipping.

Prefer adding a meaningful `mustmatch` assertion on user-visible output or a
stable JSON anchor even when the section also uses `jq -e` for structured
validation. Reserve the opt-out for genuinely exit-code-only checks or cases
without a stable, meaningful output anchor. For readability, place the opt-out
comment immediately after the `##` heading.

## Audit Method

- Measured on 2026-04-13 in this worktree after `cargo build --release --locked`.
- Derived the exact commands from `make -n spec-pr`, then added `--durations=0` and saved them in `.march/spec-pr-profile.commands.sh`.
- Removed `.cache/` before the first pass to capture cold-start behavior, then reran the same commands warm without clearing caches.
- Categories: `fast` <10s, `medium` 10-60s, `slow` >60s, `flaky` = passed during the audit but failed the final end-to-end lane due provider rate limiting, `gated` = skipped because an optional-key proof did not execute in this environment.
- `spec/03-variant.md::Searching by c.HGVS` needed a supplemental cold/warm rerun because the saved xdist `--durations=0` tables did not emit a numeric row for that heading even though both lane passes executed it; those targeted measurements are saved in `.march/review-c-hgvs-{cold,warm}.log`.
- The four gated headings in this audit stayed listed in the PR lane, but this environment did not have the provider credentials needed to execute them, so their time cells are `n/a`.

| Phase | Result | Wall Time |
|---|---|---|
| First-pass parallel | passed | `100.50s` |
| First-pass serial | passed | `77.04s` |
| Warm-pass parallel | passed | `78.51s` |
| Warm-pass serial | passed | `57.38s` |
| First-pass total | passed | `177.54s` |
| Warm-pass total | passed | `135.89s` |

The audited lane fit the PR budget before any repair: no heading crossed the 60s per-heading timeout, and the full `spec-pr` lane stayed at `177.54s` cold and `135.89s` warm. The final end-to-end `make spec-pr` verification then hit a PubMed E-utilities `429 Too Many Requests` on `spec/06-article.md::Keyword Search Can Force Lexical Ranking`, so that article-search proof moved to smoke-only coverage as the smallest reliability repair.

## spec-pr Timing Audit

| File | Heading | First-pass Time | First-pass Result | Warm-pass Time | Warm-pass Result | Category | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `spec/07-disease.md` | `Disease Funding Stays Opt-In` | `27.12s` | passed | `17.68s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | The NIH Reporter funding proofs stayed stable and well below the 60s per-heading limit, and the full lane still fits comfortably inside the PR budget. |
| `spec/02-gene.md` | `Gene Funding Stays Opt-In` | `14.74s` | passed | `14.88s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | The NIH Reporter funding proofs stayed stable and well below the 60s per-heading limit, and the full lane still fits comfortably inside the PR budget. |
| `spec/18-source-labels.md` | `Markdown Source Labels` | `13.92s` | passed | `12.28s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | Cold and warm timings stayed below 15s, so the suspected fan-out did not justify a trim or smoke-only move. |
| `spec/09-search-all.md` | `Distinct Disease And Keyword Stay Separate` | `12.27s` | passed | `6.66s` | passed | medium | move to smoke-only | Issue 182 later showed this live federated search timing out under the 60s PR timeout, so ticket 270 moves it to the serial smoke lane with 120s coverage. |
| `spec/18-source-labels.md` | `JSON section_sources — Gene, Drug, Disease` | `11.68s` | passed | `11.43s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | The core section_sources proof stayed around 11-12s on both passes, so the representative provenance contract remains cheap enough for PRs. |
| `spec/06-article.md` | `Article Query Echo Surfaces Explicit Max-Per-Source Overrides` | `11.39s` | passed | `10.29s` | passed | medium | move to smoke-only | Issue 223 reported repeated 60s PR-lane timeouts for this live article fan-out, so ticket 270 moves it to the targeted smoke lane. |
| `spec/07-disease.md` | `Disease Survival` | `10.97s` | passed | `9.05s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | Medium but stable timing; the heading stayed far below the 60s timeout and the audited lane remained well under the 10-minute target. |
| `spec/11-evidence-urls.md` | `Repaired Variant, Disease, and Drug Gaps` | `9.84s` | passed | `8.44s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | The repaired-gap regression proof stayed under 10s on both passes, so there was no measured reason to demote it to smoke-only coverage. |
| `spec/07-disease.md` | `Disease Funding` | `9.20s` | passed | `9.75s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | The NIH Reporter funding proofs stayed stable and well below the 60s per-heading limit, and the full lane still fits comfortably inside the PR budget. |
| `spec/09-search-all.md` | `Debug Plan` | `9.61s` | passed | `9.12s` | passed | fast | move to smoke-only | Issue 182 reported repeated 60s PR-lane timeouts for this multi-call live debug-plan proof, so ticket 270 moves it to the targeted smoke lane. |
| `spec/11-evidence-urls.md` | `JSON Metadata for Repaired Gaps` | `8.18s` | passed | `8.15s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | Fast and stable on both passes, so the heading stays in the PR-blocking lane. |
| `spec/06-article.md` | `Keyword Search Can Force Lexical Ranking` | `2.53s` | passed | `7.98s` | passed | flaky | move to smoke-only | Timings stayed low during the audit, but the final end-to-end `make spec-pr` run hit a PubMed `429 Too Many Requests`, so this article-search proof moved to the smoke lane. |
| `spec/09-search-all.md` | `Counts-only Mode` | `7.23s` | passed | `4.04s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | Fast and stable on both passes, so the heading stays in the PR-blocking lane. |
| `spec/09-search-all.md` | `JSON Search All Preserves Article Metadata` | `7.11s` | passed | `4.00s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | Fast and stable on both passes, so the heading stays in the PR-blocking lane. |
| `spec/09-search-all.md` | `Multi-slot Search` | `6.90s` | passed | `3.01s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | Fast and stable on both passes, so the heading stays in the PR-blocking lane. |
| `spec/22-cache.md` | `Cache Health Warning` | `n/a` | removed | `n/a` | removed | removed | removed in ticket 258 | Deleted in ticket 258 after the retained overview health heading absorbed the shipped `Cache limits` contract and the warning-path behavior stayed covered by targeted Rust unit tests. |
| `spec/01-overview.md` | `Health Check` | `12.80s` | passed | `8.98s` | passed | medium | keep in spec-pr | Ticket 258 repaired `biomcp health` with bounded ordered fan-out and a health-only per-probe timeout, then consolidated the health contract into this single retained heading. Fresh and warm reruns now stay well below the 60s PR timeout, so the heading returns to the blocking lane. |
| `spec/24-diagnostic.md` | `Local Health Readiness` | `n/a` | removed | `n/a` | removed | removed | removed in ticket 258 | Deleted in ticket 258 because the consolidated overview health heading now proves the shipped local-readiness rows, while the remaining diagnostic file focuses on source-specific search/get behavior. |
| `spec/07-disease.md` | `Disease Survival Hodgkin Mapping` | `6.09s` | passed | `5.08s` | passed | fast | keep in spec-pr | Fast and stable on both passes, so the heading stays in the PR-blocking lane. |
