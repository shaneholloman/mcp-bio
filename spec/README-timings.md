# Spec Lane Audit

## Canary Lane Contract

| Target | Run when | Timeout | Scope | Cache contract |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `make spec-contracts` | legacy profile-compatible deterministic subset | `180s` per heading | offline deterministic executable contracts, including local MCP transport proof and `spec/surface/test_parallel_isolation_contract.py` | uses the release binary selected by `PATH` and `BIOMCP_BIN`; no live-smoke commands run in this lane |
| `make verify` | explicit opt-in operator confidence before releases or upstream checks | n/a | live public-upstream matrix for discover/OLS4, disease, article source status, variant normalization, phenotype, protein, pathway, and other live entity/surface specs | every command goes through `tools/biomcp-ci`, which owns cache/XDG roots and optional-key stripping |
| `make release-live-smoke` | compatibility alias for operators that still use the old live-lane name | n/a | delegates to `make verify` | not part of routine gates |
| `make spec-pr` | PR CI canary and repo-local debugging of the offline executable corpus | `180s` per heading | explicit `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS` only: local/fixture-backed specs and static surface contracts | CI restores `.cache/biomcp-specs/`; cache hits export `BIOMCP_SPEC_CACHE_HIT=1`, which makes `tools/biomcp-ci` replay the warm HTTP cache with `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` |
| `make spec` | repo-local routine spec gate and spec debugging | `120s` per heading | the same offline `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS` set as `make spec-pr` | uses the same wrapper/cache root; it should pass with external network blocked while local mock servers remain reachable |
| `make test-contracts` | PR contracts lane and local docs/Python validation | n/a | Rust release build plus Python/docs contract checks | independent of the executable-spec wrapper |

Routine validation now uses offline/deterministic lanes: `make spec` and
`make spec-pr` run only explicit `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS`, and `make spec-contracts`
keeps a legacy deterministic subset available for profile compatibility. Public upstream confidence is
live and opt-in through `make verify` (`make release-live-smoke` remains a
compatibility alias). Ticket 395 moves every live public-upstream spec out of
routine collection: phenotype/Monarch, protein/UniProt and ComplexPortal,
disease/discover OLS4 paths, pathway Reactome/WikiPathways/KEGG, plus the other
entity/surface specs that still exercise public APIs. Deterministic request,
source, fixture, renderer, local study, variant guardrail, and local MCP
contracts own routine proof, while `make verify` owns the operator live matrix.
Ticket 379 pruned representative live public-upstream assertions from
`spec/entity/article.md`, `spec/entity/variant.md`, `spec/entity/disease.md`,
and `spec/surface/discover.md`: deterministic request, source, fixture, and
renderer contracts own routine proof, while `make verify` owns live confidence
and `make release-live-smoke` remains the compatibility name for that operator
lane.
The executable docs themselves call `tools/biomcp-ci`; `make spec` and
`make spec-pr` choose timeout over the same offline path set. `scripts/run-specs.sh`
sets up the local fixtures, keeps `target/release/biomcp` on `PATH` and in
`BIOMCP_BIN`, and runs Markdown specs with the standalone `mustmatch test`
binary. Python static contracts remain on plain pytest legs rather than the
Markdown runner.

| `spec/entity/diagnostic.md` | diagnostic canary for source-aware search, gene-first GTR guidance, compact discovery rows, and WHO detail paths |
| `spec/entity/vaers.md` | vaers canary for vaccine-first CDC aggregation, aggregate-only reporting, and explicit source limitations/combined output |
| `spec/surface/cli.md` | CLI surface canary for top-level help/list discovery, operator commands, cache-mode exceptions, and health/admin guidance |
| `spec/surface/mcp.md` | MCP surface canary for stdio/HTTP entrypoints, probe routes, and streamable-HTTP tool execution |
| `spec/surface/discover.md` | onboarding-surface canary for discover resolution, suggest routing, skill guidance, and fallback behavior |

## Bash Mustmatch Lint Rule

Every `##` spec section with at least one non-skipped `bash` block must include
at least one `| mustmatch` line unless the section explicitly opts out with
`<!-- mustmatch-lint: skip -->`.

This rule exists because executable Markdown only runs bash blocks that pipe to
`mustmatch`. A section that only uses `jq -e` or other exit-code checks can be
reported as skipped instead of proving the intended user-visible behavior.

Prefer adding a meaningful `mustmatch` assertion on user-visible output or a
stable JSON anchor even when the section also uses `jq -e` for structured
validation. Reserve the opt-out for genuinely exit-code-only checks or cases
without a stable, meaningful output anchor. For readability, place the opt-out
comment immediately after the `##` heading.

## Audit Method

- Measure in the current worktree after `cargo build --release --locked`.
- Keep Python setup project-free: `uv sync --extra dev --no-install-project`,
  then `uv run --no-sync ...` for pytest/spec commands.
- Run `make spec` and `make spec-contracts` for routine offline/deterministic
  timing. Run `make verify` only when intentionally measuring live upstream
  confidence.
- `tools/biomcp-ci` owns `BIOMCP_CACHE_DIR`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`,
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, optional-key stripping, and the `BIOMCP_SPEC_CACHE_HIT=1`
  to `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` warm-hit replay switch.
- The routine deterministic lane should stay within the spec-v2 design budget:
  `<=5 minutes` warm and `<=15 minutes` cold per cache schema/version key.
- CI's `spec-stable` job restores `.cache/biomcp-specs/` with the key
  `spec-http-${runner.os}-${biomcp-version}-${spec-cache-schema-version}`.
- `spec-cache-schema-version` is a workflow-local literal so incompatible cache
  layouts stay explicit in review.

## Warm Timing Record

Warm timing records before ticket 395 included the old live/cache-backed
`make spec-pr` corpus. After ticket 395, `make spec`/`make spec-pr` are offline
routine lanes and `make verify` is the operator-run live lane. The prior
`make spec-contracts` measurement (`386.98s` on beelink on `2026-05-23`) remains
recorded in the `spec-only` validation-profile comment until the next timing
refresh.

## Per-Section Warm Ceilings

| Section | Lane | Ceiling | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec/entity/gene.md::All-Section Warm Budget` | quarantined from routine `make spec-pr` by ticket 372 | n/a | This timing-only canary failed twice during routine `make spec-pr` at 45599ms and 43332ms against the former 12000ms ceiling. Per ticket 371's request-contract strategy, restore it only as a deterministic benchmark/ratchet or explicit performance lane, not as a default live-heavy spec blocker. |
