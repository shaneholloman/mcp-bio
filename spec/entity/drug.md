# Drug Queries

Drug lookups have to bridge brand names, regulatory regions, and sparse evidence
without pretending those are the same question. These canaries keep the drug
surface focused on region truthfulness, canonical identity routing, and the new
structured DDInter interaction workflow before operators widen to safety or
literature.

## Multi-Region Search

Plain-name search should still show the same drug family across the U.S., EU,
and WHO views so operators can compare regulatory coverage in one place.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci search drug trastuzumab --limit 3 | mustmatch like '## US (MyChem.info / OpenFDA)
## EU (EMA)
## WHO (WHO Prequalification)'
../../tools/biomcp-ci search drug trastuzumab --limit 3 | mustmatch '/\|Trastuzumab\|Biotherapeutic Product\|[^|]+\|[^|]+\|[^|]+\|BT-ON[0-9]+\|/'
```

## Brand-Name Bridge

Brand-name `get` requests should land on the canonical generic identity, not a
brand-local card that keeps all downstream commands on the alias spelling.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci get drug Keytruda | mustmatch like '# pembrolizumab
biomcp drug trials pembrolizumab'
```

## Research-Code Bridge

Quarantined from routine `make spec-pr` by ticket 382. The former live
`MK-3475` assertions expected the paper/sponsor code to canonicalize to
`pembrolizumab` and keep next commands on the INN, but current runtime can emit
an `mk-3475` card and paper-code trial pivot instead. That alias behavior is a
drug canonicalization question, not a routine PR-gate blocker.

Keep this heading as the restoration anchor. Bring the behavior back only as a
fixture-backed drug alias/canonicalization request contract, or as an explicit
release/live-smoke canary after the ticket 371 request-contract reset reaches
drug alias surfaces.

## Ambiguous Research-Code Fallback

Quarantined from routine `make spec-pr` by ticket 380. The former live
`MK-7684` assertion depended on ambiguous upstream drug discovery behavior and
blocked unrelated March work when the runtime returned not-found search guidance
instead of alias-disambiguation text.

Keep this heading as the restoration anchor. Bring the behavior back only as a
fixture-backed alias/disambiguation contract or as an explicit release/live-smoke
canary after the ticket 371 request-contract reset reaches drug/alias surfaces.

## Structured Drug Interactions

When the question is explicitly about drug-drug interactions, the helper should
surface a dedicated DDInter-backed report instead of asking the operator to
infer partner classes from a generic drug card.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci drug interactions warfarin | mustmatch like '# warfarin
## Interacting Drug Classes
anti-infectives
antiplatelets
| statins |'
```

## Oncology Interaction Class Rollups

The same helper should stay useful for oncology drugs, where class-level
grouping is often more actionable than a long flat list of partner rows.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci drug interactions imatinib | mustmatch like '# imatinib
## Interacting Drug Classes
| CYP3A4 |'
```

## Indication Structured Search

A structured indication miss is still informative. BioMCP should say that the
regulatory evidence is absent and point the user toward broader literature.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci search drug --indication 'Marfan syndrome' --limit 3 | mustmatch like 'This absence is informative
biomcp search article -k "Marfan syndrome treatment" --type review --limit 5
Try: biomcp discover "Marfan syndrome"'
```

## WHO Regulatory Detail

WHO prequalification should stay readable as a regional table with the stable
columns operators need for procurement and regulatory review.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci get drug trastuzumab regulatory --region who | mustmatch like '## Regulatory (WHO Prequalification)
| WHO ID | Type | Presentation / INN |
Samsung Bioepis NL B.V.'
```

## Section Parity for Interaction Detail

`get drug <name> interactions` should render the same DDInter-backed interaction
contract as the helper instead of falling back to a separate low-fidelity
interaction section.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci get drug warfarin interactions | mustmatch like '## Interactions (DDInter)
## Interacting Drug Classes
anti-infectives'
```

## Targets & Trial Pivots

Regional regulatory detail should not crowd out targetability or the related
trial/adverse-event pivots that a clinician uses from the same card.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci get drug pembrolizumab targets regulatory --region eu | mustmatch like '## Regulatory (EU - EMA)
## Targets (ChEMBL / Open Targets)
biomcp drug trials pembrolizumab'
../../tools/biomcp-ci get drug pembrolizumab targets regulatory --region eu | mustmatch '/PDCD1\nMore:/'
```

## Truthful Source-Empty Interaction State

DDInter empty states should be phrased as source empties. BioMCP must never
turn a missing DDInter row into a claim that the anchor drug has no clinical
interactions.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci drug interactions daraxonrasib | mustmatch like 'current DDInter download bundle has no matching rows'
../../tools/biomcp-ci drug interactions daraxonrasib | mustmatch not like 'no clinical interactions'
```

Uncovered drugs should also carry a structured coverage status so agents can
branch on a source-coverage miss instead of treating an empty table as safety
evidence.

```bash
../../tools/biomcp-ci --json drug interactions dabigatran | mustmatch like '"coverage_status": "not_in_ddinter_coverage"'
../../tools/biomcp-ci drug interactions dabigatran | mustmatch like 'current DDInter download bundle has no matching rows
not_in_ddinter_coverage
source coverage miss'
```
