# Discover, Suggest, and Skill

These three commands form BioMCP's onboarding surface: `discover` is primarily
the single-entity resolver for free text plus a small set of already-supported
routed prompts, `suggest` picks a worked-example playbook, and `skill` opens the
longer guide behind that playbook. The canaries here keep that first-move
surface focused on real routing behavior instead of incidental copy.

## Discover Request Planning Happens Before Source Calls

`discover` normalizes free text into a request-command seam before OLS4,
UMLS, or MedlinePlus clients are constructed. That seam records the trimmed
query, command-versus-alias-fallback mode, OLS4 lookup query, and whether
MedlinePlus/cache behavior is enabled, so routine tests can prove routing intent
without depending on a live ontology service.

## Alias-Like Free Text Still Resolves to Typed Follow-Ups

When the query is a familiar alias rather than a canonical gene symbol,
`discover` should still surface the canonical concept and a usable next command.

```bash
out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci discover ERBB1)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Discover: ERBB1"
echo "$out" | mustmatch '/\*\*EGFR\*\* \(`HGNC:3236`\)/'
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`biomcp get gene EGFR`'
```

## Disease-Specific Symptom Phrases Stay Clinically Modest

Queries that ask for symptoms of a known disease should route to disease
phenotypes, keep the resolved disease visible in concepts, and treat
UMLS/MedlinePlus plain-language context as optional enrichment rather than a
baseline requirement. The CI wrapper strips `UMLS_API_KEY`, so this canary
asserts the degraded-mode banner instead of depending on live UMLS enrichment.

```bash
out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci discover "symptoms of Marfan syndrome")"
concepts="$(printf '%s\n' "$out" | awk '/^## Concepts$/{in_concepts=1; next} /^## /{in_concepts=0} in_concepts')"
echo "$concepts" | mustmatch like "Marfan syndrome"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "UMLS enrichment unavailable"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`biomcp get disease "Marfan syndrome" phenotypes`'
```

## HPO-Backed Symptom Phrases Should Bridge into Phenotype Search

The discover guide says symptom concepts with HPO-backed IDs should suggest a
phenotype search first. That keeps symptom-first queries on the phenotype
surface instead of dropping straight into broader disease search.

```bash
json_out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci --json discover "developmental delay")"
echo "$json_out" | mustmatch like "HP:0001263"
echo "$json_out" | jq -e '._meta.next_commands[0] == "biomcp search phenotype \"HP:0001263\""' >/dev/null
```

## Relational Queries Redirect Instead of Surfacing Weak Collocation Noise

`discover` should stay honest about its role: it resolves single entities and a
few routed exceptions, but relational or multi-entity questions should redirect
to `search all --keyword` when only weak residue remains.

### Warfarin relational query

```bash
out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci discover "drug classes that interact with warfarin")"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Discover: drug classes that interact with warfarin"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`discover` resolves single entities. For relational questions, try: biomcp search all --keyword "drug classes that interact with warfarin"'
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`biomcp search all --keyword "drug classes that interact with warfarin"`'
if echo "$out" | grep -Fq "Interact with Friends Less than I Would Because of Hearing Question"; then
  echo "$out"
  exit 1
fi
```

### MEF2 relational query

Ticket 371 identified this live OLS4 discover path as a request-contract risk;
routine coverage for the MEF2 relational redirect is now restored through Rust
fixture-backed request-command and request-plan tests. The `DiscoverRequest`
seam records command-mode routing before clients are constructed,
`OlsSearchRequestPlan` asserts OLS4 search construction, and fixture hits prove
the router redirects to `search all --keyword` when only weak general hits
remain. Any live OLS4 upstream probe belongs in a release/live-smoke lane, not
routine `make spec-pr`.

## No-Match Discover Queries Fall Back to Article Search

Free text that does not resolve to a biomedical concept should still end with a
next step rather than a dead end.

```bash
out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci discover zzzxqv)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "No biomedical entities resolved."
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`biomcp search article -k zzzxqv --type review --limit 5`'
```

## Suggest Keeps the Playbook and No-Match Contracts

`suggest` is the offline first move for question routing. Matched responses
should point to the concrete playbook, and no-match should stay successful with
the same four-field JSON shape.

```bash
out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci suggest "What drugs treat melanoma?")"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like 'matched_skill: `treatment-lookup`'
echo "$out" | mustmatch like '`biomcp skill treatment-lookup`'
json_out="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci --json suggest "What is x?")"
echo "$json_out" | mustmatch like '"matched_skill": null'
echo "$json_out" | jq -e '.first_commands == [] and .full_skill == null' >/dev/null
```

## Suggest Decomposition Keeps the First-Move Router Review-Sized

The behavior checks above protect the public playbook response. The router also
needs its documented ownership zones so future route additions do not collapse
back into one large catch-all module.

```bash
set +e
structure_out="$(cd ../.. && cargo test --test suggest_cli_structure -- --nocapture 2>&1)"
structure_status=$?
set -e
echo "$structure_out" | mustmatch like "suggest_split_files_exist_with_doc_headers"
test "$structure_status" -eq 0
```

## Skill Still Opens the Longer Guide

Once `suggest` points to a playbook, the user still needs both the worked-example
index and the canonical agent guide behind `skill render`. The rendered prompt
should also carry the stricter discover framing and the relational-query
counter-examples so installed `SKILL.md` matches the canonical prompt.

```bash
overview="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci skill)"
echo "$overview" | mustmatch like 'biomcp suggest "<question>"'
list="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci skill list)"
echo "$list" | mustmatch like "# BioMCP Worked Examples"
echo "$list" | mustmatch like "treatment-lookup"
render="$(../../tools/biomcp-ci skill render)"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "## Routing rules"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "## How-to reference"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "single-entity free-text lookup only"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "biomcp discover BRCA1"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "biomcp discover dabigatran"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "### Don't use \`discover\` for relational or list questions"
echo "$render" | mustmatch like '"drug classes that interact with warfarin"'
echo "$render" | mustmatch like 'biomcp search article -k "drug classes that interact with warfarin" --type review --limit 5'
echo "$render" | mustmatch like '"genes regulated by MEF2 in the heart"'
echo "$render" | mustmatch like "biomcp get gene <symbol>"
```

## Skill Decomposition Keeps Catalog and Install Ownership Separate

The behavior checks above protect the public skill output. The implementation
also needs separate asset, catalog, and install ownership zones so MCP resource
reads and filesystem installation do not collapse back into one over-cap module.

```bash
set +e
structure_out="$(cd ../.. && cargo test --test skill_cli_structure -- --nocapture 2>&1)"
structure_status=$?
set -e
echo "$structure_out" | mustmatch like "skill_split_files_exist_with_doc_headers"
test "$structure_status" -eq 0
```
