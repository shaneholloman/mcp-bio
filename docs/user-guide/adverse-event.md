# Adverse Event

Use adverse-event commands for safety surveillance across four source-backed
paths:

- OpenFDA FAERS drug adverse-event reports,
- CDC WONDER VAERS aggregate vaccine adverse-event summaries,
- recall notices,
- device events.

Vaccine searches default to combined OpenFDA FAERS + CDC VAERS when the query
resolves to a vaccine and the active filters are VAERS-compatible. Non-vaccine
searches stay FAERS-only in practice. `--source vaers` is aggregate-only,
supports only the vaccine query text from `--drug` or the positional query,
and does not support `--reaction`, `--outcome`, `--serious`, `--date-from`,
`--date-to`, `--suspect-only`, `--sex`, `--age-min`, `--age-max`,
`--reporter`, `--count`, or `--offset > 0`.

## Search FAERS reports

By drug:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --drug pembrolizumab --limit 5
```

Serious reports only:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --drug pembrolizumab --serious --limit 5
```

Reaction-focused filter:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --drug pembrolizumab --reaction pneumonitis --limit 5
```

## Search vaccine events with VAERS

Combined FAERS + VAERS for vaccine queries:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event "COVID-19 vaccine" --source all --limit 5
```

VAERS-only aggregate summary:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event "MMR vaccine" --source vaers --limit 5
```

VAERS summaries are aggregate-only. They surface the matched vaccine display
name, CDC WONDER code, CVX code(s) when the query resolves through the CDC
CVX/MVX bridge, serious vs non-serious counts, age distribution, and top
reaction counts.

`--source` only applies to `--type faers`; recall and device searches keep
their existing source-specific paths.

## Search recall notices

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --type recall --drug metformin --limit 5
```

Classification filter:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --type recall --drug metformin --classification "Class I" --limit 5
```

## Search device events (MAUDE)

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --type device --device "insulin pump" --limit 5
```

Manufacturer filter:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --type device --manufacturer Medtronic --limit 5
```

Product-code filter:

```bash
biomcp search adverse-event --type device --product-code PQP --limit 5
```

`--manufacturer` and `--product-code` are valid only with `--type device`.

## Get a report by ID

```bash
biomcp get adverse-event 10222779
```

Report resolution is source-aware and returns the corresponding markdown format.

## Request report sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `reactions` | Adverse reactions reported |
| `outcomes` | Reaction outcomes (death, hospitalization, etc.) |
| `concomitant` | Concomitant medications |
| `guidance` | Safety guidance and labeling |
| `all` | Include all sections |

```bash
biomcp get adverse-event 10222779 reactions outcomes
biomcp get adverse-event 10222779 all
```

## Helper commands

There is no direct `adverse-event <helper>` family. Use
`biomcp drug adverse-events <name>` when you want the inbound drug pivot into
this safety surface.

## JSON mode

```bash
biomcp --json get adverse-event 10222779
```

## Practical tips

- Include drug generic names for better FAERS recall.
- Use plain vaccine names, family names, or common brand names when you want the VAERS path.
- Treat FAERS rows and VAERS aggregate counts as signal, not incidence estimates.
- Validate serious findings through full source documents when needed.
