# Drug

Use drug commands for medication lookup, target-oriented search, and U.S./EU/WHO regulatory context.

## Search drugs

Text query:

```bash
biomcp search drug -q "kinase inhibitor" --limit 5
biomcp search drug Keytruda --limit 5
```

Regional or comparison search:

```bash
biomcp search drug Keytruda --region eu --limit 5
biomcp search drug "influenza vaccine" --region ema --limit 5
biomcp search drug trastuzumab --region who --limit 5
biomcp search drug artesunate --region who --product-type api --limit 5
biomcp search drug BCG --region who --product-type vaccine --limit 5
biomcp search drug Keytruda --region all --limit 5
```

Target-oriented search:

```bash
biomcp search drug --target BRAF --limit 5
```

Indication-oriented search:

```bash
biomcp search drug --indication melanoma --limit 5
biomcp search drug --indication malaria --region who --limit 5
```

`search drug --interactions <drug>` is currently unavailable because the public data sources BioMCP uses do not expose partner-indexed interaction rows.

Omitting `--region` on a plain name/alias search checks U.S., EU, and WHO data.
If you omit `--region` while using structured filters such as `--target` or
`--indication`, BioMCP stays on the U.S. MyChem path. Explicit `--region who`
filters structured U.S. hits through WHO Prequalification for finished-pharma
and API lookups. `--product-type <finished_pharma|api|vaccine>` is WHO-only
and requires explicit `--region who`. WHO vaccine search is plain name/brand
only, so structured WHO filters reject `--product-type vaccine`, and default
WHO search still excludes vaccines unless you request that product type
explicitly.
Explicit `--region eu` or `--region all` with structured filters still errors.
`ema` is accepted as an input alias for the canonical `eu` region value.
When MyChem cannot resolve a vaccine brand name, omitted `--region` on a plain
name search, explicit `--region eu|all`, and explicit WHO vaccine
name/brand search with `--product-type vaccine` can also use the local CDC
CVX/MVX bundle to expand vaccine aliases. That bridge does not change WHO
finished-pharma/API matching, does not create a WHO vaccine `get drug` detail
surface, and does not run for pure `--region us` searches.

WHO vaccine support in this release is search-only. Use
`search drug <name> --region who --product-type vaccine` for vaccine rows;
`get drug <name> regulatory --region who|all` remains finished-pharma/API only.

## Get a drug record

```bash
biomcp get drug pembrolizumab
```

Default output provides concise identity and mechanism context. Approval-bearing
JSON includes additive `approval_date_raw`, `approval_date_display`, and
`approval_summary` fields, while markdown renders the human-friendly display
date in the base card. Default drug output and the `targets` section keep
generic targets from ChEMBL/Open Targets and may add a separate `Variant
Targets (CIViC): ...` line when CIViC surfaces a variant-specific molecular
profile such as `EGFRvIII`.

## Request drug sections

Supported sections: `label`, `regulatory`, `safety`, `shortage`, `targets`,
`indications`, `interactions`, `civic`, `approvals`, `all`.

FDA label section:

```bash
biomcp get drug vemurafenib label
```

Shortage section:

```bash
biomcp get drug carboplatin shortage
```

Regional regulatory and safety sections:

```bash
biomcp get drug trastuzumab regulatory --region who
biomcp get drug Keytruda regulatory --region eu
biomcp get drug Dupixent regulatory --region ema
biomcp get drug trastuzumab regulatory --region all
biomcp get drug Keytruda regulatory --region all
biomcp get drug Ozempic safety --region eu
biomcp get drug Ozempic shortage --region eu
```

If you omit `--region` on `get drug <name> regulatory`, BioMCP checks U.S. and
EU regulatory data. Other no-flag `get drug` shapes keep the default U.S. path
unless you pass `--region` explicitly.

Targets and indications sections:

```bash
biomcp get drug pembrolizumab targets
biomcp get drug pembrolizumab indications
```

`get drug <name> targets` is a mixed-source workflow:

- Generic targets come from ChEMBL and Open Targets.
- Variant-specific target annotations may be added from CIViC.
- Full CIViC evidence tables remain opt-in via `get drug <name> civic`.

Interactions (OpenFDA label text when public interaction details are available; otherwise a truthful fallback):

```bash
biomcp get drug warfarin interactions
```

CIViC evidence and Drugs@FDA approvals:

```bash
biomcp get drug vemurafenib civic
biomcp get drug dabrafenib approvals
```

`approvals` remains a legacy U.S.-only section. Use `regulatory` for the region-aware regulatory view.

## EMA local data setup

EU regional commands read EMA local data from `BIOMCP_EMA_DIR` first, then the
platform data directory (`~/.local/share/biomcp/ema` on typical Linux systems).
On first use, BioMCP auto-downloads the six EMA human-medicines JSON feeds
into that root and refreshes stale files after 72 hours. Use `biomcp ema sync`
to force a refresh at any time. `--region ema` is accepted anywhere BioMCP
documents the canonical `eu` region value.

Manual preseed still works. If you need an offline or pre-populated root, place
these files in the target directory:

- `medicines.json`
- `post_authorisation.json`
- `referrals.json`
- `psusas.json`
- `dhpcs.json`
- `shortages.json`

Confirm local EMA readiness with full health output:

```bash
biomcp health
```

Force-refresh EMA local data manually:

```bash
biomcp ema sync
```

EMA row meanings:

- `configured`: `BIOMCP_EMA_DIR` is set and complete
- `configured (stale)`: `BIOMCP_EMA_DIR` is set and complete, but one or more EMA files are older than the 72-hour refresh window
- `available (default path)`: the default platform data directory contains a complete EMA batch
- `available (default path, stale)`: the default platform data directory contains a complete EMA batch, but one or more EMA files are older than the 72-hour refresh window
- `not configured`: no EMA batch is installed at the default path yet
- `error (missing: ...)`: the EMA directory exists but is missing one or more required files

## WHO Prequalification local data setup

WHO regional searches and regulatory commands read the WHO Prequalification
exports from `BIOMCP_WHO_DIR` first, then the platform data directory
(`~/.local/share/biomcp/who-pq` on typical Linux systems). On first use,
BioMCP auto-downloads the finished-pharmaceutical-products CSV, the
active-pharmaceutical-ingredients CSV, and the vaccine export into that root
and refreshes stale files after 72 hours. Use `biomcp who sync` to force a
refresh at any time.

Manual preseed still works. If you need an offline or pre-populated root,
place these files in the target directory:

- `who_pq.csv`
- `who_api.csv`
- `who_vaccines.csv`

Confirm local WHO readiness with full health output:

```bash
biomcp health
```

Force-refresh WHO local data manually:

```bash
biomcp who sync
```

WHO row meanings:

- `configured`: `BIOMCP_WHO_DIR` is set and complete
- `configured (stale)`: `BIOMCP_WHO_DIR` is set and complete, but at least one WHO export is older than the 72-hour refresh window
- `available (default path)`: the default platform data directory contains a complete WHO root with all three exports
- `available (default path, stale)`: the default platform data directory contains all three WHO exports, but at least one is older than the 72-hour refresh window
- `not configured`: no complete WHO root is installed at the default path yet
- `error (missing: ...)`: the WHO directory exists but is missing one of the required files

## CDC CVX/MVX local data setup

Default plain-name vaccine searches that include the EU path can use local CDC
CVX/MVX data as a vaccine identity bridge when MyChem does not recognize the
brand name directly. BioMCP reads `BIOMCP_CVX_DIR` first, then the platform
data directory (`~/.local/share/biomcp/cvx` on typical Linux systems). On
first use, BioMCP auto-downloads `cvx.txt`, `TRADENAME.txt`, and `mvx.txt`
into that root and refreshes stale files after 30 days. Use `biomcp cvx sync`
to force a refresh at any time.

The CDC bundle only augments omitted `--region` plain-name vaccine searches and
explicit `search drug <name> --region eu|all` vaccine searches after MyChem
identity resolution misses. It also augments explicit WHO vaccine name/brand
searches when you pass `--region who --product-type vaccine`. It does not
inject aliases into WHO finished-pharma/API lookups or `get drug`, and
`--region us` does not create or read the CVX root.

Manual preseed still works. If you need an offline or pre-populated root,
place these files in the target directory:

- `cvx.txt`
- `TRADENAME.txt`
- `mvx.txt`

Confirm local CDC readiness with full health output:

```bash
biomcp health
```

Force-refresh CDC CVX/MVX local data manually:

```bash
biomcp cvx sync
```

CDC row meanings:

- `configured`: `BIOMCP_CVX_DIR` is set and the full CDC bundle is present
- `configured (stale)`: `BIOMCP_CVX_DIR` is set and complete, but at least one CDC file is older than the 30-day refresh window
- `available (default path)`: the default platform data directory contains a complete CDC CVX/MVX bundle
- `available (default path, stale)`: the default platform data directory contains a complete CDC bundle, but at least one file is older than the 30-day refresh window
- `not configured`: no complete CDC CVX/MVX root is installed at the default path yet
- `error (missing: ...)`: the CDC directory exists but is missing one or more required files

## Helper commands

Trial pivot:

```bash
biomcp drug trials pembrolizumab --limit 5
biomcp drug trials daraxonrasib --limit 20
biomcp drug trials daraxonrasib --no-alias-expand --limit 20
```

On `--source ctgov`, `drug trials <name>` inherits the shared trial
intervention alias expansion. Expanded results surface `Matched Intervention`
in markdown and `matched_intervention_label` in JSON when an alternate alias
matched first. Use `--no-alias-expand` to force literal matching.

Safety pivot:

```bash
biomcp drug adverse-events pembrolizumab --limit 5
```

## JSON mode

```bash
biomcp --json get drug pembrolizumab
biomcp --json search drug Keytruda --region eu --limit 3 | jq '.regions.eu.results[0].ema_product_number'
biomcp --json search drug Keytruda --region all --limit 3 | jq '.regions | keys'
```

`search drug --json` always returns the same top-level shape: `region`,
`regions`, and optional `_meta.next_commands`. Each region bucket keeps the
single-region wrapper fields `pagination`, `count`, and `results`.

- Use `regions.us.results` for U.S. search rows.
- Use `regions.eu.results` for EMA rows.
- Use `regions.who.results` for WHO Prequalification rows.
- Omitted `--region` on a plain name/alias search and explicit `--region all`
  include all three buckets under `regions`.

## Practical tips

- Start with base `get` before requesting heavy sections.
- Use target filters to narrow crowded drug classes.
- Use `regulatory` with `--region who|all` when you need WHO Prequalification context.
- Use `regulatory`, `safety`, or `shortage` with `--region eu|all` when you need EMA context; `ema` is accepted as an input alias for `eu`.
- Omit `--region` on `get drug <name> regulatory` when you want the default combined U.S. and EU regulatory view.
- Pair drug lookups with trial filters for protocol matching workflows.
