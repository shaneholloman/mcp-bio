# WHO Prequalification

WHO Prequalification matters when you need global regulatory context for medicines used across procurement and access programs outside the U.S./EU-only lens. It is the right page for questions about whether a medicine appears in the WHO finished-pharmaceutical-products list or the WHO active-pharmaceutical-ingredients list, and for comparing that status with other regional drug views.

In BioMCP, WHO Prequalification is a local-runtime source for drug name/alias lookups and regional regulatory sections rather than a live per-request API surface. BioMCP auto-downloads both the finished-pharmaceutical-products CSV and the active-pharmaceutical-ingredients CSV into `BIOMCP_WHO_DIR` or the default data directory on first use, supports `--region who|all`, lets structured `--region who` searches filter structured U.S. hits through WHO prequalification, supports `--product-type <finished_pharma|api>` on explicit WHO searches, and exposes `biomcp who sync` when you want a forced refresh of both exports.

## What BioMCP exposes

| Command | What BioMCP gets from this source | Integration note |
|---|---|---|
| `search drug <name> --region who` | WHO-prequalified drug matches by name or alias | Uses the local WHO finished-pharma + API batch for WHO-only name/alias lookups |
| `search drug <name> --region all` | Combined U.S., EU, and WHO name/alias search | Adds WHO rows to the split all-region output |
| `search drug --indication <disease> --region who` | WHO-prequalified rows filtered from structured U.S. search hits | Keeps MyChem structured semantics and narrows results through the WHO batch |
| `search drug <name> --region who --product-type <finished_pharma|api>` | WHO-only source-type filtering | Narrows WHO search rows to finished pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical ingredients |
| `get drug <name> regulatory --region who|all` | WHO or combined regulatory context | WHO-backed regional regulatory section |

## Example commands

```bash
biomcp search drug trastuzumab --region who --limit 5
```

Returns WHO-prequalified trastuzumab rows from the local WHO dataset.

```bash
biomcp search drug artesunate --region who --product-type api --limit 5
```

Returns only WHO active-pharmaceutical-ingredient rows for artesunate. `--product-type` requires explicit `--region who`.

```bash
biomcp search drug --indication malaria --region who --limit 5
```

Filters structured U.S. malaria hits through the local WHO prequalification batch.

```bash
biomcp get drug trastuzumab regulatory --region who
```

Returns WHO-backed regulatory context for the WHO region.

```bash
biomcp get drug imatinib regulatory --region who
```

Returns the truthful WHO empty state when the drug is not WHO-prequalified.

```bash
biomcp who sync
```

Refreshes both local WHO exports without waiting for the next automatic sync.

## API access

No BioMCP API key required. BioMCP auto-downloads the WHO finished-pharmaceutical-products CSV and active-pharmaceutical-ingredients CSV into `BIOMCP_WHO_DIR` or the default data directory on first use.

## Official source
