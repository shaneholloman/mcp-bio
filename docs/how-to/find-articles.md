# How to: find articles

This guide shows practical literature-search patterns.

## Translate a question into filters

When the gene, disease, or drug is already known, put that anchor in a typed
flag and keep the mechanism, phenotype, dataset, or outcome in `-k`.

Known anchor plus concept:

```bash
biomcp search article -g TP53 -k "apoptosis gene regulation" --limit 5
```

Unknown entity, keyword first:

```bash
biomcp search article -k '"cafe-au-lait spots" neurofibromas disease' --type review --limit 5
```

Do not guess `-g`, `-d`, or `--drug` when the question is trying to identify
the entity itself. Keep the first search keyword-only, or start with
`biomcp discover "<question>"` if you want a typed follow-up command first.
Question-format terms can stay in the article filters: PubMed ESearch cleans
bounded filler words from unfielded gene, disease, drug, and keyword terms
provider-locally, while query echoes and non-PubMed sources keep the original
wording.

If the whole keyword exactly matches a gene, drug, or disease vocabulary label
or alias, keyword-only article search may return a typed `get` suggestion in
`See also`, `_meta.next_commands`, and JSON `_meta.suggestions[]`. Treat that
as a structured follow-up option, but do not expect direct entity suggestions
for multi-concept phrases such as `BRAF V600E` or `lung cancer immunotherapy`.

Dataset or method question:

```bash
biomcp search article -k "TCGA mutation analysis dataset" --type review --limit 5
```

Refine with typed flags before paginating:

```bash
biomcp search article --drug amiodarone -k "photosensitivity mechanism" --limit 5
```

If the first page reveals the gene, disease, or drug that actually anchors the
question, rerun with that typed flag before you spend time paginating a noisy
keyword-only result set.

## Avoid keyword reformulation loops

When an agent is iterating on one literature task, pass a short local
`--session` label and request JSON. If the next keyword search overlaps the
previous same-session keyword by at least 60% after BioMCP removes common
search filler words, JSON `_meta.suggestions[]` can point to a better fallback:
inspect the prior hits with `article batch`, map the topic with `discover`, or
narrow by publication year when the current page supports that retry.

```bash
biomcp --json search article -k "Oncotype DX review" --session lit-review-1 --limit 5
biomcp --json search article -k "Oncotype DX DCIS" --session lit-review-1 --limit 5
```

Treat `--session` as a non-secret local correlation label. Do not put PHI,
credentials, email addresses, or user identifiers in it. Markdown article
search output does not show loop-breaker suggestions.

## Start from a known anchor

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF --limit 10
```

`search article` always works without credentials. BioMCP keeps
`sort=relevance` as the default, but the effective ranking mode depends on the
query: keyword-bearing searches default to hybrid scoring, while entity-only
searches default to lexical directness. LitSense2 joins keyword-bearing
federated searches, and the Semantic Scholar leg is still eligible whenever the
filter set is compatible. `S2_API_KEY` upgrades those Semantic Scholar
requests to authenticated quota; without it, BioMCP uses the shared pool.
BioMCP also caps each federated source's contribution after deduplication and
before ranking. Default: 40% of `--limit` on federated pools with at least
three surviving primary sources. Rows count against their primary source after
deduplication. Use `--max-per-source <N>` to override that cap, use
`--max-per-source 0` for the default cap explicitly, and set it equal to
`--limit` to disable capping.

## Search PubMed directly

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF --source pubmed --limit 5
```

Direct PubMed search and the compatible federated PubMed leg apply the same
question-format cleanup before ESearch, so a keyword question can still echo
as written while PubMed receives content terms.

## Add disease context

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF -d melanoma --limit 10
```

## Tune semantic versus lexical balance

```bash
biomcp search article -k "Hirschsprung disease ganglion cells" --ranking-mode hybrid --weight-semantic 0.5 --weight-lexical 0.2 --limit 5
```

Use `--ranking-mode lexical` to force the old directness comparator on a
keyword query, `--ranking-mode semantic` to sort by the LitSense2-derived
semantic signal first, or `--weight-*` flags to retune the default hybrid
formula `0.4*semantic + 0.3*lexical + 0.2*citations + 0.1*position`. Rows
without LitSense2 provenance contribute `semantic=0` in semantic-aware
ranking modes.

## Cap one source explicitly

```bash
biomcp search article -k "Kartagener syndrome ciliopathy" --limit 50 --max-per-source 10
```

## Constrain by date

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF --since 2024-01-01 --limit 10
```

## Exclude preprints when supported

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF --since 2024-01-01 --no-preprints --limit 10
```

## Pull the full-text section

```bash
biomcp get article 22663011 fulltext
```

## Fetch several shortlisted papers at once

```bash
biomcp article batch 22663011 24200969 39073865
```

Use `article batch` after search when you already know the candidate PMIDs or
DOIs and want compact title/journal/year/entity cards before opening one paper
in full detail. The helper preserves input order and still works when
`S2_API_KEY` is unset.

## Use `--type` carefully

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF --type review --limit 5
```

`--type` on the default `--source all` route uses Europe PMC + PubMed when the
other selected filters are PubMed-compatible. If you also need
`--open-access` or `--no-preprints`, PubMed drops out and the search collapses
to Europe PMC-only with an explicit note. Use `--source pubmed` when you want
PubMed-only article search on the compatible filter set and do not need those
PubMed-incompatible filters.

## Inspect the ranking rationale in JSON

```bash
env -u S2_API_KEY biomcp --json search article -g BRAF --limit 3
```

Look for `semantic_scholar_enabled`, row-level `matched_sources`, and
`ranking` metadata to see why a paper ranked where it did. Hybrid rows expose
normalized semantic, lexical, citation, and source-position components plus the
composite score; lexical rows preserve the existing directness metadata.

## Inspect the executed search plan

Markdown:

```bash
env -u S2_API_KEY biomcp search article -g BRAF --debug-plan --limit 3
```

JSON / MCP-friendly text output:

```bash
env -u S2_API_KEY biomcp --json search article -g BRAF --debug-plan --limit 3
```

`--debug-plan` adds a top-level `debug_plan` payload in JSON and prepends the
same payload as a fenced JSON block in markdown. Request JSON+plan for MCP
callers with `--json --debug-plan`.

## Follow-up pattern

After identifying key papers, pivot to trials or variants:

```bash
biomcp search trial -c melanoma --mutation "BRAF V600E" --limit 5
biomcp search variant -g BRAF --limit 5
```
