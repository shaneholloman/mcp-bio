# Skills

BioMCP ships one embedded guide plus supporting reference files and worked
examples for agent workflows. The current workflow is:

```bash
biomcp skill
biomcp skill render
biomcp skill list
biomcp skill article-follow-up
biomcp skill install ~/.claude
```

## Read the overview

`biomcp skill` prints the embedded `skills/SKILL.md` overview. Start there if
you want the current BioMCP workflow guidance without installing anything into
an agent directory.

`biomcp skill render` prints the same canonical agent-facing prompt for
scripts and eval runners. Redirected output from `biomcp skill render` is the
same content installed as `SKILL.md`.

## Learn the workflows

Use `biomcp skill list` to browse the embedded worked examples and
`biomcp skill <slug|number>` to open one in the CLI:

```bash
biomcp skill list
biomcp skill article-follow-up
biomcp skill variant-pathogenicity
```

Current builds ship 15 worked examples. The catalog keeps the original
treatment lookup, symptom lookup, gene-disease orientation, and article
follow-up examples, plus expanded playbooks such as `variant-pathogenicity`,
`drug-regulatory`, `trial-recruitment`, `mutation-catalog`, and
`negative-evidence`. The installed `skills/` tree also includes worked
examples you can read directly in the repo or in an agent directory:

- [Guide Workflows](../how-to/guide-workflows.md) - variant pathogenicity,
  drug safety, and broad gene-disease investigation

## Install into an agent directory

Install the embedded `skills/` tree into your agent directory:

```bash
biomcp skill install ~/.claude
```

Force replacement of an existing install:

```bash
biomcp skill install ~/.claude --force
```

The `dir` argument can point at an agent root such as `~/.claude`, an existing
`skills/` directory, or a `skills/biomcp/` directory. When you omit `dir`,
BioMCP attempts supported agent-directory detection in your home directory and
the current working tree, then prompts before installing when stdin is a TTY.

## Install payload

Current builds install the full embedded reference tree into
`<agent>/skills/biomcp/`, including:

- `SKILL.md`
- `use-cases/`
- `jq-examples.md`
- `examples/`
- `schemas/`

The install payload also includes `schemas/workflow-ladder.schema.json` and
seven `use-cases/<slug>.ladder.json` sidecars for workflow ladders:
`treatment-lookup`, `article-follow-up`, `variant-pathogenicity`,
`trial-recruitment`, `mechanism-pathway`, `pharmacogene-cumulative`, and
`mutation-catalog`. These JSON sidecars are not listed by `biomcp skill list`;
they are runtime metadata assets paired with the numbered markdown playbooks.

When a first-call JSON response matches a ladder trigger, BioMCP can emit
`_meta.workflow` plus `_meta.ladder[]`. The ladder commands are static copies of
the matching playbook's fenced bash block; they are not templated with user
input. `_meta.next_commands` remains the dynamic one-hop follow-up list for the
current result.
