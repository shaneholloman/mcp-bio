# Source Versioning Matrix

This matrix tracks which upstream API endpoints are version-pinned and where unversioned endpoints remain intentional.

| Source | Base URL | Version status | Rationale | Last reviewed |

## Notes

- If a provider introduces a stable version path, update the corresponding `src/sources/*.rs` base constant and this table in the same change.
- CDC WONDER VAERS intentionally stays out of `./scripts/contract-smoke.sh`: the
  D8 contract is POST/XML, relatively volatile, and already covered by the
  real-query health row plus fixture-frozen unit/spec tests.
- gnomAD versioning is handled by dataset selection in GraphQL variables and is verified by dataset fallback tests.
