//! The runtime no-store pin for GWAS (ticket 1268 follow-up,
//! 2026-09-29 second review): reqwest-middleware 0.4.2 exposes
//! `RequestBuilder::extensions()` publicly, so the invariant is
//! proven on the middleware builder the cache layer reads — before
//! `build()`, which hands off to reqwest and drops the middleware's
//! extension view (the first attempt read `Request::extensions()`
//! after `build()` and hit reqwest's private method; CI run
//! 36619750222, error E0624).

use super::super::*;
use http_cache_reqwest::CacheMode;

/// Every GWAS request carries `CacheMode::NoStore`, whatever
/// `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE` says: both plan entry points route through
/// `request_no_store`, and the extension sits on the middleware
/// builder the cache middleware inspects.
