# 1284 — close the fifth go-request round

Filed 2026-10-01 with `sdlc/records/1284-close-the-fifth-go-request-round.md`; closes `sdlc/issues/2026-09-30-review-of-the-fifth-0.9.1-go-request.md`, whose dispositions are appended to it.

## What landed

- The blocker: container-publish carries `contents: write` (drafts are visible only to write-capable tokens), and `test_jobs_downloading_the_draft_release_can_write_contents` fails any job that downloads the release before publish-release without write access. Mutation-verified: reverting to `contents: read` fails the test.
- The exit-code case is pinned (`test_the_decision_case_accepts_exactly_zero_three_and_catchall`; widening `3)` to `3|*)` fails), and the gh guard finds gh mid-line (`if ! gh`, `$(gh …)`), verified on samples.
- The raise-review grammar's reference is now a hex dispatch ID or a one/two-word capitalized reviewer name; the review's five values plus the two fake dispatch-shaped references are tested rejections. Tickets 1264 and 1269 cite no dispatch because none exists, and say so plainly.
- Record 1283 written with all eight run IDs, both failures included. Dispositions appended to the fourth and fifth review files.
- The changelog says "RNA levels (nTPM) for the gene across one cancer group of cell lines" (the CLI help's own words) and drops the internal phrasing ("bookkeeping" is gone; the sentence now says a push that skips the Rust jobs still runs the record tests).
- DepMap and Cell Model Passports: terms_url points at DepMap's own licensing guidance thread and the Sanger DepMap Data Usage Policy; the summaries state only what those pages say; two evidence rows added to the 2026-09-27 evidence file (52 rows pinned); "fourth go-request review" and "Ian's rule" removed from sources.json.
- The rehearsal item landed in checklist section 1, and the rehearsal itself runs on `genomoncology/biomcp-release-rehearsal` (private scratch copy; main carries this branch plus one commit pointing the image at the scratch repository and the publish step at TestPyPI).

## Convention recorded

sources.json entry moves (re-sorts) stay out of content commits; the 1283-round sort that mixed them is accepted history.

## Worked release checklist for 0.9.1 (section 1)

- [x] Dispositions: every finding in the fourth and fifth review files carries a disposition (this round's commits; the lesser notes are accepted with reasons).
- [x] Ticket/record/review: tickets 1219-1284 have ticket files and records; review verdicts with dispatch references are in the tickets (1264 and 1269 honestly cite none); record 1283 names its runs.
- [x] Fresh read-only review through the final tip: dispatch recorded below; commits e84d83f6 and dda87d73 (post-verdict commits from the last round) are in its evidence bundle explicitly.
- [x] Claimed fixes fail when reverted: container-publish permissions, the case arms, and the grammar rejections were mutation-verified (commands and outputs in the review artifacts).
- [x] New sources' terms stated: DepMap and Cell Model Passports carry terms in both registries with evidence rows.
- [x] Changelog: 61 tickets covered on a scratch tag (`check-changelog-coverage.py --tag v0.9.1`); the six issues named.
- [x] Version files: `check-version-sync.sh` and `check-release-versions.py --tag v0.9.1` pass.
- [x] Branches: this round merges `--no-ff` after its green run; merged branches deleted; worktrees removed; 1.0 team branches untouched.
- [x] Candidate main run green: recorded in the go request (eight jobs).
- [x] Live docs serve the candidate commit: recorded in the go request.
- [x] GH_REPO/checkout guard and draft-write guard: pinned by tests (above).
- [ ] Rehearsal: in progress, blocked on org billing, not on code. Ian redirected the rehearsal away from TestPyPI (2026-10-01): the publish step becomes a credential-free `uvx twine check dist/*` and docs-live is stubbed, both listed as stated differences in the rehearsal copy's header. The rehearsal then found and fixed two real release blockers, both landed, reviewed and merged: ticket 1285 (wheel-smoke queried DDInter on a cold cache, which errors by design — the smoke now syncs first; every leg green after the fix) and ticket 1286 (GitHub moved macos-latest to arm64 mid-day, so the x86_64 wheel-smoke leg pins macos-15-intel). Third run 36896962624: 18 jobs green through all five wheel-smoke legs; container-publish was NOT STARTED because the org's Actions spending limit was reached (annotation: "The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased") — the draft download, both image smokes, the latest move, the public flip and the Homebrew skip remain unexercised until billing is lifted. The scratch repository keeps its draft release and tag for that continuation.

## Review

- Code review: ACCEPT 2026-10-01 dispatch 16d922f8-6baa-4a4a-be90-959000d4580b (Claude vendor, read-only) — the blocker fix, the case pin, the mid-line gh guard, the grammar's five rejections, the records and dispositions, the changelog wording and the sources terms all verified; one P2 folded at this commit (the word "bookkeeping" still in the changelog line; now reworded away), and one note that the scratch repository's commit graph is external to the clone — the go request carries the run URL instead.
