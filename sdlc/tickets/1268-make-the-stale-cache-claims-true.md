# Make the stale-cache claims true

From sdlc/issues/2026-09-28-review-follow-ups-after-1263-and-1264.md
(Stale-cache note section and Stdio test section). The 1263 round
overclaimed in three places; this ticket makes the code, the tests,
and the records agree.

## Fixes

1. GWAS: the exclusion was false — apply_cache_mode replaced GWAS's
   no-store mark with force-cache under BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite.
   Choice: GWAS keeps NoStore unconditionally (the decode-failure
   bypass is the recorded reason in gwas.rs); apply_cache_mode is no
   longer applied to GWAS requests. Proof, stated at what it really
   shows (2026-09-29 reviews corrected an overstated sentence here):
   the text contract `tests/test_gwas_no_store_contract.py` pins the
   source shape (every request path routes through the builder;
   `apply_cache_mode` never runs for GWAS). A runtime pin asserting
   the extension on the built request was attempted and rejected by
   the compiler: the vendored reqwest keeps `Request::extensions`
   private outside its crate (CI run 36619750222, error E0624). No
   test runs the command under `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` against
   a dead fixture.
2. ClinGen prefetch: carries the NO_CACHE flag across the spawn the
   same way it carries the notes handle. Proof:
   `no_cache_skips_the_cache_for_the_spawned_clingen_fetch` — a warm
   cache then a dead server then `--no-cache` must fail rather than
   serve the cached rows to the prefetch.
3. Tests parse `_meta.notes` (article and search-all); the
   search-all end-to-end stale serve is restored (2026-09-29):
   Europe PMC rides the killable fixture and the other three
   federated legs return 404 from a live fixture so no retry burns
   the per-source budget; the ClinGen end-to-end stale test exists
   (the prefetch's stale serve reaches the gene card, with MyGene
   served fresh so only the ClinGen leg is stale), and the file
   header claims exactly what the file tests.
4. TLS retry: reqwest-retry's default strategy marks every
   connect-layer error transient, so a rejected certificate (a
   deterministic failure) was retried with backoff — the ~2 s stall
   the review measured. Decision: exclude trust failures from
   retries via a RetryableStrategy wrapper (NoTrustFailureStrategy)
   that walks the error chain for certificate-trust markers and
   returns None (no retry) for them; both client builders use it.
5. Stdio stderr read: read once after a bounded child.wait() — the
   early 2 s pipe-take raced the server's exit under load and
   discarded the partial read (warning count read 0).

## Dispositions (recorded, not changed)

- The probe test's process-wide counter assertion
  (src/cli/outcome/probe_tests.rs): KEEP. The test asserts both the
  dedicated probe counter (zero) and the production counter
  (unchanged) so the seam cannot drift from what production counts;
  nextest (the gate and CI runner) isolates it per process. The
  plain-`cargo test` residual — another test's one-shot landing in
  the armed window — is documented in the module comment and
  accepted: the lane that matters never runs that shape.

## Pins raised (reviewer verdict required)

- `tools/rust-source-size-inventory.json` src/sources/mod.rs
  2717 -> 2782: the retry-strategy wrapper and the no-cache carry
  helpers. The reason is in the inventory entry; accept or reject
  with this branch.
- No wait-ratchet ceilings changed; the three marked
  freshness-window waits in the new test file are all on their sleep
  lines.

## Review

- Design review: n/a (the review file named the fixes)
- Code re-review (pass 1): REJECT 2026-09-29 (worker dispatch 8b4ea1e6-9682-4559-8256-7279343f1f26) — P0 compile error in the runtime pin (associated-fn call with wrong arity) and P1 the overstated GWAS proof sentence; folded (fixed) in c6f3cb57.
- Code re-review (pass 2): REJECT 2026-09-29 (reviewer artifact bb5eafdb-9b35-447a-9f22-18081a451228) — size-inventory pin mismatch, the false extensions reason, the e2e grep instead of a `_meta.notes` parse, the wait-count claim four-should-be-three, the nonexistent infinite-mode proof, and the blanket TLS claim; all folded (fixed) in b6ca0ceb, with the TLS boundary scoped to the middleware clients and the plain-send residual recorded in the record file.
- Code re-review (pass 3): REJECT 2026-09-29 (worker dispatch 12920b92-d7e9-4de4-b871-ba9ee5d3e12f) — every folded fix verified correct; one P1 remained: the three record lines on this ticket sat outside the review-status grammar (kinds must be `code review`/`code re-review` with a parenthetical scope, and no pending line may sit on a landed ticket); folded (fixed) here. The re-review request for the final state rides this history, not a status line.
- Code re-review (final pass): ACCEPT 2026-09-29 (worker dispatch 4304c685-8ea1-42b8-93ea-f7258988f683) — all seven folded-state checks verified at 95a4998b: the uncompilable runtime pin gone with the compiler evidence recorded (E0624, run 36619750222), the text contract primary again, the raised-baseline doc landed, the toolchain modules marked, the package ceiling and rationale exact, the four suites 25 passed, the e2e parses _meta.notes. No findings. History: the 2026-09-28 ACCEPT was fabricated and reverted before these passes.
- Verification: yellow gate at f86a548e; merged in the 535747d9 chain (full gate on this branch before merge)
