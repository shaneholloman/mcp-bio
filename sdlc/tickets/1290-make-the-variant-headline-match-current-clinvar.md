# 1290 — make the variant headline match current ClinVar

Proposed 2026-10-03 by the BioMCP owner for the next 0.9 release. Status: accepted, ready to build.

## Evidence

Experiment 432 (`~/workspace/experiments/432-agent-legs-with-skills/`) asked agents for the current ClinVar classification of 19 variants reclassified after 2026-03-01. The diagnosis covers 16 of the 17 tool-leg misses; one cell was not diagnosed. 8 came from BioMCP's own output. The owner reproduced one on 0.9.1:

`biomcp get variant "TP53 G105S" clinvar -j` prints top-level `significance: "Pathogenic"`. The same output's NCBI ClinVar section holds RCV001379190, `Uncertain significance`, reviewed by expert panel, evaluated 2026-06-04. ClinVar's current germline classification for VariationID 428884 is Uncertain significance.

6 more misses came from agents turning a list of pathogenic and likely pathogenic submissions into "Conflicting", because BioMCP prints RCV records but no record-level (VCV) germline classification.

## Retained behavior

Every existing section, field name and source stays. The default `get variant` path makes no new network call. The NCBI ClinVar section keeps its RCV aggregates and submissions.

## Change

The headline `significance` is set in `from_myvariant_hit` (`src/transform/variant.rs:849`, assigned at :884) by `pick_significance` (:672-685). It picks the most pathogenic RCV classification in MyVariant.info's cached copy. `search variant` rows use the same derivation (:938). The NCBI ClinVar fetch runs only when the `clinvar` or `all` section is requested (`src/entities/variant/get.rs:1232-1233`).

1. Parse ClinVar's record-level germline classification (`ClassifiedRecord/Classifications/GermlineClassification`) into a new `ClinvarRecord` field with its review status and date (`src/sources/ncbi_efetch.rs`).
2. When the `clinvar` section answers from NCBI ClinVar, the headline shows that record-level classification, review status and date, and names NCBI ClinVar as its source. When the record has no germline classification, the headline says so and keeps the derived value labeled as derived.
3. Plain `get variant` and `search variant` keep the fast MyVariant.info-derived value, so no extra call is added to the default path. The output names that source, states that it is the most severe RCV classification in a cached copy, gives the newest evaluation date in that copy, and prints the `clinvar` section command as the way to get the current ClinVar classification.
4. When the cached value and NCBI ClinVar disagree, the output says so.
5. `skills/use-cases/05-variant-pathogenicity.md` tells agents to request the `clinvar` section and read the record-level classification first.

## Proof

- A spec case on a recorded fixture where the cached source and NCBI ClinVar disagree, showing the headline follows NCBI ClinVar and names it.
- A regression on TP53 c.313G>A (VariationID 428884) from a recorded response.
- Rerun of experiment 432's ClinVar items, reported in the record.

## Deferred

Somatic and oncogenicity classifications. The other 2 misses (a variant BioMCP could not resolve) belong to ticket 1292.

## Review

- Ticket review: ACCEPT 2026-10-03 on the second pass, dispatch 26de9b8f (fresh SWE-2 researcher, read-only). The first pass returned FIX; the revision addressed every finding.
