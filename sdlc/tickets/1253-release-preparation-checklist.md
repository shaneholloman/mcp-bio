# Release preparation checklist for 0.9.1

Accumulates the release-prep items recorded across tickets so nothing hangs on memory. Work this ticket only after Ian says release. Nothing here runs before that.

## Changelog bullets (from the 1234 dry run)

The coverage gate is right and it lists the missing tickets itself: run it in dry-run form against the candidate tag and write a user-facing bullet for every ticket it names, in the Unreleased section, then flip the heading to `## 0.9.1 — <date>`. Do not trust a hand-copied list. The dry run observed on 2026-09-28, after the gate's dated-record fix, reported 30 tickets (the tool's discovery applies v0.9.0..HEAD against the Unreleased section; the count grows with every merged ticket — recompute from the tool, never from this list): 1220, 1222, 1223, 1224, 1226 through 1239, 1241, 1242, 1243, 1244, 1247, 1248, 1250, 1254, 1255, 1257, 1259, 1261. The 2026-09-27 licensing note first parsed as ticket 2026 until the gate's record pattern excluded dated names; tickets with bullets already (1240, 1246, 1249, 1251, 1252, 1256, 1258) drop off as they land.

## Residuals recorded as "exercise at the release run"

Checklist form (the 2026-09-26 review asked for items that fail the prep if skipped) — tick each during the release run, not before:

- [ ] 1221: the leftover CA bundle check on a live host.
- [ ] 1222: the release upload itself (container, wheels, tarballs, formula) and the Homebrew formula's honesty against the tag.
- [ ] 1225: the wheel-stack smoke args after the container legs run.
- [ ] 1245/1249: the container build path's first live exercise at the tag — watch the pypi-build and build jobs actually run, not skip.
- [ ] 1254 b2: the oldest real licensing review date crosses the 365-day fail on 2027-03-20; confirm the review pass happened and the registry dates moved (see the 2026-09-27 licensing pass record).

## Ordering

- Tag pushes trigger the release workflow: version bumps and the `## Unreleased` flip land on main first, then the tag.
- The Homebrew tap waits for `publish-release` (the release is public) and for PyPI; the tap formula's version and sha256 come from the published artifacts.
- The docs-live revision gate needs the site's revision file to reflect the tag; retry window is 600 s.

## After the tag

- Close #250 (wheel on older Linux), #282, #284 (tools/list inputSchema missing type — fixed by 1240/1251; close once the released schemas are verified live), #286 (cache-mode test leak, fixed by 1261), and #287 (debug-profile wheels broke skill, chart, and --json ladders; the 0.9.1 wheel job builds --release and the smoke now exercises the asset paths positively) once the artifacts are public and verified.
- The #283 reporter reply (fix shipped, pointer to the patched artifact) needs Ian's OK before posting.
- Post-release: sweep the Unreleased residuals from 1241 (Mac real-bundle run) and confirm the M5 checklist issue closes.
