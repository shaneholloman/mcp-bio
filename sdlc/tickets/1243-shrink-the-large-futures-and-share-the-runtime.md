# Shrink the large futures and share the runtime

Split from ticket 1238. Source issue:
`sdlc/issues/2026-09-23-large-futures-and-per-call-runtimes.md`.

## Problem

The top-level command future reaches 145 KB and the 8 MiB execute stack
left only about sixteen times headroom in release (less in debug)
before ticket 1225's fix; the cause is `with_no_cache` taking a future
by value (doubling 71 KB to 142 KB), unboxed command dispatch futures,
and an inlined `tokio::join!` in both match arms of the discover chain.
Separately, every CLI call builds and drops a Tokio runtime; dropping
waits unboundedly for background blocking work, so a timed-out call
still blocks the reply, and pooled connections stay tied to dead
runtimes. XML parsing caps node count but not nesting depth, so a
deeply nested document on a 2 MiB blocking thread can overflow.

## Design

1. Make `with_no_cache` a plain function returning
   `NO_CACHE.scope(no_cache, fut)` so the future is taken once.
2. `Box::pin` each command dispatch future in the outcome runner; box
   the discover join.
3. A stable size probe: a unit test in `src/cli/outcome/tests.rs`
   parses a minimal CLI, constructs the future, and asserts
   `std::mem::size_of_val(&fut)` under a recorded ceiling (future
   construction is lazy; no I/O runs). The probe bounds
   `run_outcome_inner`'s future and the `run` fallthrough directly —
   not `run_outcome`'s wrapper, which is already boxed and tiny.
   Record the measured before/after in the ticket.
4. Stop constructing a runtime per call. The construction site is
   `run_outcome_with_worker_stack` (`src/cli/outcome.rs:610-626`),
   and it serves both process kinds: CLI one-shots via `run_outcome`
   and every MCP tool call via `mcp/shell.rs:414`. Split the paths:
   the MCP path drives the command future on the shared server
   runtime (capture the `Handle`, `block_on` from the dedicated
   8 MiB thread — `EXECUTE_STACK_BYTES` stays 8 MiB per ticket
   1225's pin), so a server process keeps one long-lived runtime and
   pooled connections stop dying per call; the CLI one-shot keeps a
   per-call runtime but drops it with `shutdown_background`, so the
   reply never blocks on background work. Background work today is
   only cache eviction (`spawn_eviction_task`,
   `src/cache/manager.rs`, `spawn_eviction_task`); all cache puts are awaited
   inline (`put` in the same file), and that invariant is what makes
   `shutdown_background` safe — record it in the code comment, since
   fire-and-forget puts would be lost under `shutdown_background` +
   `process::exit`. Acceptance: a test that MCP tool dispatch
   constructs no runtime (assert the construction path is not taken —
   e.g. a counter or a stub seam), and the hanging-background-task
   test covers a blocking task (a started eviction-style task must
   not delay the reply).
5. XML depth cap: a post-parse iterative walk inside
   `parse_external_xml` (`src/xml.rs:13-85`) counting element depth,
   rejecting above the cap with a new `ExternalXmlError` variant; the
   existing byte loop ignores tag structure and is the wrong place.
   The walk protects the recursive JATS/ClinVar walkers on the 2 MiB
   blocking threads; the acceptance nesting-bomb test also proves
   roxmltree's own parse does not recurse by depth. The blocking-pool
   stack raise names its runtimes: the `outcome.rs:615` builder for
   CLI one-shots, and the shared server runtime (replace
   `#[tokio::main]` with an explicit `Builder`) — headroom on top of
   the depth cap, which is the control.
6. Deferred from the issue, recorded so closing the umbrella does not
   erase them: retries firing on POST requests, and
   `TRIAL_ALIAS_CACHE` growing without limit
   (`src/entities/drug/get.rs:353`).

## Acceptance

- The size-probe test exists and the measured futures (the dispatch
  future and the `run` fallthrough) are recorded before and after.
- No per-call runtime drop blocks the reply: the hanging-background
  test covers a blocking, eviction-shaped task, and MCP tool dispatch
  constructs no runtime of its own (a test asserts the construction
  path is not taken).
- The XML depth cap rejects a nesting bomb with an error.

## Review

- Design review: REJECT once (item 4 named the wrong seam — the
  per-call runtime at outcome.rs:610-626 serves the MCP path too;
  probe misstated; depth-cap placement unspecified; two issue items
  dropped silently), findings folded, re-review ACCEPT 2026-09-25
- Code review: ACCEPT with five P2s folded 2026-09-27
- Verification: yellow gate at b0930b51 lint/test/spec/stress OK;
  see `sdlc/records/1243-shrink-the-large-futures-and-share-the-runtime.md`

## Implementation state (2026-09-27)

Measured future sizes (bytes, debug test profile, via the probe's
assert messages):

- base fe691c48: dispatch 225,312; run 227,856
- after the scoped no-cache return: dispatch 113,520; run 114,512
- after boxing the arms and join: dispatch 2,240; run 2,656

Items:

1. DONE — `with_no_cache` returns `NO_CACHE.scope(no_cache, fut)`
   (commit b39881ea).
2. DONE — all 15 `with_no_cache` dispatch arms boxed in
   `run_outcome_inner`, 47 handler awaits boxed in `run`, and the
   four-way OLS/UMLS/Medline/identity join boxed in discover
   (all-to-completion semantics unchanged) (commit 5a8f2909).
3. DONE — the stable probe lives in
   `src/cli/outcome/probe_tests.rs` with the measured history in its
   doc comment; ceilings 4,096 (dispatch) and 8,192 (run)
   (commit 5a8f2909).
4. DONE — `WorkerDrive::Shared(Handle)` drives MCP calls
   (`execute_mcp_cli`, falling back to one-shot with no ambient
   runtime) on the server's long-lived runtime; `WorkerDrive::OneShot`
   keeps a per-call runtime dropped with `shutdown_background`
   (commit b3e390db). The eviction-safety invariant is recorded at
   `drive_one_shot` (puts awaited inline in `manager.rs` `put`, only
   eviction backgrounded at manager.rs:407-431). Acceptance tests
   landed: MCP dispatch builds no runtime (counter seam) and a
   2 s blocking sleeper does not delay a one-shot reply (elapsed
   asserted under 1 s).
5. DONE — XML depth cap at 64 levels, set from the corpus (deepest
   tracked fixture nests 9; JATS stays an order below). DEVIATION
   RECORDED: the design placed the walk post-parse, but the
   nesting-bomb test proved roxmltree's own parse recurses per open
   tag (the test overflowed the stack inside Document::parse), so the
   counter runs in the pre-parse byte scan and rejects before
   parsing; the revision is commented in the code. Blocking-thread
   stacks raised to 4 MiB on both runtimes item 4 touched: the
   one-shot builder (`thread_stack_size` in `drive_one_shot`) and the
   shared server runtime (main.rs replaced `#[tokio::main]` with an
   explicit Builder); the 8 MiB execute-stack pin from ticket 1225 is
   unchanged and commented.
6. Nothing to do (deferrals already recorded above).

Checkpoint at implementation time: the yellow gate, the full
suite, and `cargo check --test rmcp_client_contract` were unverified
after the final XML edit. The gate has since run — see the Review
section's verification line (b0930b51, all four phases OK).
