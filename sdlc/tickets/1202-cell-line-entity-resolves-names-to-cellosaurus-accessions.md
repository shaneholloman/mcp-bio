# 1202: A cell-line entity resolves names to Cellosaurus accessions

## Goal

`biomcp search cell-line <name>` turns any common spelling of a cell line (MOLM13, MOLM-13, MV4-11, MV4;11) into its Cellosaurus accession. `biomcp get cell-line <CVCL_xxxx>` returns one card with name, synonyms, species, disease, category, sex, and age. Its `xrefs` section lists the cross-references other sources join on, and its `variants` section lists the curated sequence variations. `get cell-line` also accepts a DepMap, Cell Model Passports, ChEMBL, or PharmacoDB ID and resolves it to the accession. The accession is the join key for tickets 1205 and 1206. The motivating consumer is a hackathon team screening public GEO studies of drug-treated AML cell lines, which met the same line under four spellings.

## Current Facts

- No code, doc, or fixture mentions Cellosaurus today. `grep -rli cellosaurus` matches only one recorded Europe PMC article body under `testdata/sources/variant_articles_683/`.
- The entity inventory is `ENTITY_FLAGS` (`src/cli/list/catalog.rs:38`), with section names mapped per entity at `src/cli/list/catalog.rs:78`. Multi-word entities use kebab case: `("adverse-event", true, true)` (`src/cli/list/catalog.rs:52`) and `biomcp search adverse-event` (`src/cli/commands.rs:507`).
- `SearchEntity` (`src/cli/commands.rs:269`) and `GetEntity` (`src/cli/commands.rs:522`) hold one clap variant per entity. Dispatch runs through `src/cli/outcome.rs` (`GetEntity::Pathway` at `:129`, `SearchEntity::Pathway` at `:232`) and `src/cli/response_contract.rs` (`:126`, `:287`).
- The typed MCP `get` tool derives its entity list and section enum from the catalog (`typed_get_capabilities`, `src/mcp/shell/typed_get.rs:12`). A new gettable entity reaches typed MCP `get` with no tool change. The typed MCP `search` tool covers a fixed list of eight entities (`src/mcp/shell.rs:285`). Pathway search reaches MCP only through the raw tool, and a test pins that typed rejection (`src/mcp/shell.rs:1825`).
- `is_allowed_mcp_command` (`src/mcp/shell.rs:472`) matches every `Commands` and subcommand variant by name and has no wildcard arm, so a new top-level command fails the build until it is classified there.
- Section outcomes are a per-entity registry. The pathway entity builds one from its outcome keys (`default_pathway_section_outcomes`, `src/entities/pathway.rs:18`), and `spec/entity/section-outcomes.md` ties `_meta.section_sources` to it.
- Per-origin pacing and base-URL overrides live in `src/sources/rate_limit.rs`. KEGG is the model: `policy("kegg", "BIOMCP_KEGG_BASE", "https://rest.kegg.jp", 334 ms)` (`:167`). Health probes are `SourceDescriptor` rows (`src/cli/health/catalog.rs:410`).
- Pathway search args are the model for a name search: positional query plus `-q`, `--limit` 1-25 default 10, `--offset` default 0 (`src/cli/pathway/mod.rs:6`). Pathway get takes `id` plus trailing `sections` (`src/cli/pathway/mod.rs:28`).
- Each source has a page under `docs/sources/` (for example `docs/sources/kegg.md`), a row in `docs/sources/index.md` (`:44` for KEGG), a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml` (`:70`), a summary row and a tier section in `docs/reference/source-licensing.md` (tier 1 starts at `:114`), and an object in `docs/reference/sources.json` (`"id": "kegg"` at `:781`). Each entity has a user guide under `docs/user-guide/`.
- Recorded fixtures live in `testdata/sources/<source>/` with a receipt in `testdata/sources/capture-receipts.json` (153 entries are `real_and_receipted`). Routine specs replay them through `spec/fixtures/setup-provider-contract-spec-fixture.sh`, which serves `/kegg/...` (`:474`) and exports `BIOMCP_KEGG_BASE` (`:619`). `spec/entity/pathway.md` is in `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS` (`scripts/run-specs.sh:22`).

### Cellosaurus API, observed 2026-09-16 (release 56.0)

- `GET https://api.cellosaurus.org/cell-line/{ac}?format=json&fields=...` returns `{"Cellosaurus":{"cell-line-list":[record]}}`. An unknown accession returns HTTP 404.
- `GET /search/cell-line?q=<solr>&format=json&fields=...&rows=N&start=M` returns the same envelope with no total count. `rows` defaults to 1000. The OpenAPI spec (`/openapi.json`) also lists `sort`.
- `fields=ac,id,sy,ox,di,ca,sx,dr` cuts the MOLM-13 record from 156 KB to 19 KB. The same projection is 323 KB for K-562, which carries 1,013 ENCODE and 207 GEO cross-references. Without `dr` the MOLM-13 projection is 2,073 bytes, and adding `var` makes it 4,449 bytes (survey of 2026-09-17, workspace experiment 204). The projected record carries `accession-list` (`type` primary or secondary), `name-list` (`type` identifier or synonym), `species-list` (NCBI_TaxID `accession` and `label`), `disease-list` (`database` NCIt or ORDO, `accession`, `label`), `category`, `sex`, and `xref-list` (`database`, `accession`, `url`).
- The xref `database` names the ticket needs are `DepMap` (ACH-000362 for MOLM-13, ACH-000045 for MV4-11), `Cosmic-CLP`, `ChEMBL-Cells`, `Cell_Model_Passport`, `GDSC`, `PharmacoDB`, and `LINCS_LDP`. Across ten AML and leukemia test lines, DepMap, Cell Model Passports, ChEMBL, and PharmacoDB links exist for all ten. U-937 (CVCL_0007) has no `GDSC` and no `Cosmic-CLP` link. No test line has an HPA link. The record also carries 25 `Cosmic` sample rows for MOLM-13. Those are sample IDs and stay out of the card. No `rrid` field exists. Cellosaurus is the RRID authority for cell lines, and the RRID is `RRID:` plus the primary accession.
- The default keyword search ranks badly for exact names. `q=K562` finds 374 records and puts K-562 (CVCL_0004) at position 383 of the TSV output. `q=HL60` puts four derived lines ahead of HL-60.
- The fielded query `q=idsy:"<name>"` searches the name and synonyms. `idsy:"MV4;11"` returns 3 records, `idsy:"MOLM13"` returns 1, `idsy:"K562"` returns 366. `idsy:"KO"` fills the 1000-row window, so a window can end before the exact match.
- Normalized comparison finds the intended line in every AML case tried: lowercase and drop every non-alphanumeric character from the query, the name, and each synonym. MOLM13 matches CVCL_2119, MV4;11 matches synonym MV4;11 on CVCL_0064, HL60 matches CVCL_0002. The 2026-09-16 KG1 facts are stale. On 2026-09-17 `idsy:"KG1"` returned three records in this order: CVCL_E3VV (mouse), CVCL_0374 (KG-1, human), and CVCL_UD72. All three match exactly after normalization.
- Results change with spelling. `idsy:"KG-1"` returns CVCL_0374, CVCL_2971 (KG-1-C), and CVCL_1S07. `idsy:"NB-4"` returns CVCL_0005 alone.
- Upstream order can put the wrong line first. `idsy:"NB4"` returns SJNB-4 (CVCL_8821, a neuroblastoma line that lists `NB4` as a synonym) at position 16 and the real NB4 (CVCL_0005) at position 21. Both match exactly after normalization. NB4 is the line's identifier. On SJNB-4 it is only a synonym. The exact match can also sit near the end of the window: K562 at 360 of 366, THP1 at 68 of 69.
- HL-60 (CVCL_0002) and the NCI-60 line HL-60(TB) (CVCL_A794) are separate records. The `NCI-DCTD` link on CVCL_A794 holds the name `HL-60`, so a name join from NCI-60 lands on the wrong line. Cellosaurus has no PharmacoDB link for CVCL_A794.
- Reverse lookup works through the `dr:` field. `q=dr:ACH-000362`, `q=dr:SIDM00437`, and `q=dr:MOLM13_950_2019` each return CVCL_2119 alone.
- `sequence-variation-list` (field `var`) holds 1 to 5 curated entries per test line. Each entry has a variation type, an HGVS description, an HGNC cross-reference, zygosity, and PubMed sources. OCI-AML-3 lists DNMT3A p.Arg882Cys, NPM1 p.Trp288Cysfs*12, and NRAS p.Gln61Leu.
- `/release-info` reported release 56.0, 2026-06-25, 168,970 lines. No rate limit appears in the headers.
- Terms: Cellosaurus data is CC BY 4.0. The requested citation is Bairoch A. "The Cellosaurus, a cell line knowledge resource." J. Biomol. Tech. 29:25-38 (2018). The site publishes no rate limit. BioMCP needs no key.

## Design

### Source module

`src/sources/cellosaurus.rs`, declared in `src/sources/mod.rs`, uses `shared_client()` and `env_base("https://api.cellosaurus.org", "BIOMCP_CELLOSAURUS_BASE")`. Add a `rate_limit.rs` policy for that origin at 334 ms, matching KEGG, because Cellosaurus publishes no limit. Three calls:

- `get(accession, fields)`: `/cell-line/{ac}?format=json&fields=<fields>`. The card fields are `ac,id,sy,ox,di,ca,sx,ag`. The request adds `var` when the `variants` section is asked for and `dr` when `xrefs` or a join section (tickets 1205, 1206, and later ones) is asked for. The card alone never fetches `dr`. A 404 maps to the repo's not-found error.
- `search_names(name)`: `/search/cell-line?q=idsy:"<escaped>"&format=json&fields=ac,id,sy,ox,di,ca&rows=1000`. The escape backslash-quotes `"` and `\`. It returns the rows and a `window_full` flag set when 1000 rows came back.
Both searches call one `search(q, fields, rows)` primitive, so ticket 1213 adds an `id:` wrapper rather than a third request path.

- `search_xref(id)`: `/search/cell-line?q=dr:"<escaped>"&format=json&fields=ac,id&rows=10`. The recorded fixture confirms that the quoted form returns the same record as the unquoted form.

### Entity

`src/entities/cell_line.rs` owns the types, the normalizer, and ranking.

- `CellLine`: `accession`, `secondary_accessions`, `rrid`, `name`, `synonyms`, `species` (a list of taxon id and label, in upstream order, because a hybrid record carries more than one: CVCL_1S07 in the KG-1 window lists both Cricetulus griseus and Homo sapiens), `diseases` (database, accession, label), `category`, `sex`, `age`, `variants`, and `xrefs`. `xrefs` holds only the join keys, in this fixed order: `depmap`, `cosmic_clp`, `chembl`, `cell_model_passport`, `gdsc`, `pharmacodb`, `lincs_ldp`. Each is a list, so a record with two DepMap IDs keeps both. Every key is present. A missing link is an empty list, so U-937 shows `gdsc: []`. `source` is `Cellosaurus` and the card carries the CC BY 4.0 attribution line.
- `variants`: one row per `sequence-variation-list` entry with gene symbol, HGNC ID, variation type, HGVS description, zygosity, and PubMed IDs, in upstream order and as published. BioMCP adds no interpretation.
- Search row: `accession`, `name`, `species`, `category`, first disease label, `match` (`exact` or `partial`), and `matched_on` (`name` or `synonym`, set on exact rows). `exact` means the normalized query equals the normalized name or any normalized synonym. `matched_on: name` means the query equals the record's identifier name. Rows sort in this order: exact identifier matches, then exact synonym-only matches, then partial matches. Within each group human lines come first, then upstream order. A row counts as human when any entry in its species list is taxon 9606. `--offset` and `--limit` apply after sorting. The total is the row count when the window was not full. A full window makes the total unknown and adds one note: `Cellosaurus returned 1000 rows; an exact match may lie past this window. Use a more specific name or the CVCL accession.`
- Spelling: when the query contains a hyphen, search runs twice, once with the raw query and once with every hyphen removed. The rows merge by accession before ranking. Merged upstream order is the raw-query window in its order, then the rows seen only in the hyphen-stripped window in theirs. The match kind is computed after the merge from the normalized query, so the two windows cannot disagree. A full window on either request sets the total to unknown.
- More than one exact match is reported as it is. The rows show the species and the match kind that tell KG-1 from KG1 and NB4 from SJNB-4. The ranking orders the rows. BioMCP still picks no winner and hides no row.
- A query that already looks like an accession (`^CVCL_[A-Z0-9]{4}$`, case-insensitive) searches `ac:` instead and returns that one row as `exact`.
- Reverse lookup: `get cell-line <id>` treats any ID that is not a CVCL accession as a source ID and calls `search_xref`. Examples are DepMap `ACH-000362`, Cell Model Passports `SIDM00437`, ChEMBL `CHEMBL3706573`, and PharmacoDB `MOLM13_950_2019`. One result opens that record. Zero results give the not-found error with the hint `biomcp search cell-line <id>`. More than one result fails and lists the accessions. The card prints the ID it was resolved from.

### CLI and MCP

- `SearchEntity::CellLine(CellLineSearchArgs)` with the pathway argument shape: positional query or `-q`, `--limit` 1-25 default 10, `--offset` default 0. Search takes no filters.
- `GetEntity::CellLine(CellLineGetArgs)` with `id` and trailing `sections`. Sections are `variants`, `xrefs`, and `all`. The default card shows the card fields only and ends with the next commands `biomcp get cell-line <ac> variants` and `biomcp get cell-line <ac> xrefs`. The requested sections widen the `fields` list of the one record request, so no section in this ticket makes an extra call. A reverse lookup adds one search request before it.
- `section_outcomes`: the entity carries the registry from the start, following the pathway entity (`default_pathway_section_outcomes`, `src/entities/pathway.rs:18`), with the keys `variants` and `xrefs`. Each key completes as `data` when the projected record carried rows, `empty` when it carried none. `_meta.section_sources` is wired the way `spec/entity/section-outcomes.md` requires. Tickets 1205, 1206, and 1214 then add one key each (`drug_response`, `depmap`, `chembl`) and nothing else. Building the registry here costs one field and spares three tickets a retrofit.
- Catalog: `("cell-line", true, true)` in `ENTITY_FLAGS` (`src/cli/list/catalog.rs:38`) and `CELL_LINE_SECTION_NAMES` in the section map (`src/cli/list/catalog.rs:78`). Typed MCP `get` picks it up from the catalog. Typed MCP `search` stays at eight entities. Cell-line search reaches MCP through the raw tool, like pathway.
- MCP arms: `is_allowed_mcp_command` allows `Commands::Search` and `Commands::Get` wholesale (`src/mcp/shell.rs:479`), so the raw tool admits the new entity with no change there. The by-name matching applies to top-level commands. This ticket adds no `CellLineCommand` group; ticket 1205 adds it and classifies its arms.
- Search rows print `biomcp get cell-line <ac>` in `_meta.next_commands` for the first exact row.
- Health: one `SourceDescriptor` for Cellosaurus probing `/release-info?format=json`, affects "cell-line search and detail".
- The review note wrote `cell_line`. This ticket uses `cell-line` because every multi-word entity in the CLI and catalog is kebab case (`adverse-event`).

### Release date and attribution

Every cell line output, card and section and search result, in Markdown and in JSON, carries a `data_as_of` field and one attribution line.

- `data_as_of` holds the Cellosaurus release name and date, read from `/release-info?format=json`. Measured 2026-09-17: release 56.0, dated 2026-06-25. The value is not hard-coded. The client reads `/release-info` once per process, caches the result through the shared HTTP cache, and falls back to the retrieval time with `data_as_of_kind: "retrieved"` when the call fails. A successful read sets `data_as_of_kind: "release"`. The health probe already calls `/release-info`, so this adds no new endpoint.
- JSON carries `{"data_as_of": "56.0 (2026-06-25)", "data_as_of_kind": "release"}` at the top level of the payload. Search output has no slot for them today. `SearchJsonResponseWithMeta` (`src/cli/shared.rs:568`) gains optional `data_as_of` and `data_as_of_kind`, both skipped when `None`, so no other entity's output changes. The full-window note goes in a new `notes: Vec<String>` on `SearchJsonMeta` (`src/cli/shared.rs:541`), skipped when empty. The unknown total needs no change, because `PaginationMeta.total` is already an `Option` (`src/cli/shared.rs:480`).
- Markdown for `data_as_of_kind: "retrieved"` names no release. The line reads `Cellosaurus, retrieved <RFC 3339 time>, CC BY 4.0. Cite Bairoch A. J. Biomol. Tech. 29:25-38 (2018).`
- Markdown ends with one fixed line: `Cellosaurus 56.0 (2026-06-25), CC BY 4.0. Cite Bairoch A. J. Biomol. Tech. 29:25-38 (2018).` The release part is the `data_as_of` value.

### Bot checks

Cellosaurus served no bot check in any measurement. The rule still holds for every request this ticket makes: an HTTP 200 whose body is an HTML human-verification page where JSON was expected is a provider error. It names the URL and the file or endpoint, and the command stops. BioMCP never retries through a check, never rewrites the request to get around one, and never falls back to scraping the page.

### Docs

- `docs/sources/cellosaurus.md` on the KEGG page model, a row in `docs/sources/index.md`, and a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml`.
- `docs/user-guide/cell-line.md`, a nav entry, and command rows in `docs/user-guide/cli-reference.md` and `src/cli/list_reference.md`. Help `after_help` examples: `search cell-line MOLM13`, `search cell-line "MV4;11"`, `get cell-line CVCL_2119`, `get cell-line CVCL_2119 xrefs`, `get cell-line CVCL_1844 variants`, `get cell-line ACH-000362`. The user guide names the HL-60 and HL-60(TB) trap.
- A tier 1 row in `docs/reference/source-licensing.md` and an object in `docs/reference/sources.json`: `direct_api`, auth `none`, CC BY 4.0, attribution and citation required on reuse, terms URL `https://www.cellosaurus.org/description.html`, reviewed 2026-09-16.

## Fixtures

Record these through the production request path into `testdata/sources/cellosaurus/`, each with a `real_and_receipted` receipt. No fields are removed.

- `search_idsy_molm13_20260916.json`: one row, CVCL_2119.
- `search_idsy_molm_13_20260917.json` for `idsy:"MOLM-13"`: ten rows, CVCL_2119 the one exact match. The hyphen rule sends this request beside the unhyphenated one, and acceptance 2 needs both to answer.
- `search_idsy_mv4_11_semicolon_20260916.json` for `idsy:"MV4;11"`: three rows, CVCL_0064 exact.
- `search_idsy_kg1_20260917.json`: three rows (CVCL_E3VV, CVCL_0374, CVCL_UD72), all exact. It replaces the stale 2026-09-16 capture.
- `search_idsy_kg_1_20260917.json` for `idsy:"KG-1"`: CVCL_0374, CVCL_2971, CVCL_1S07.
- `search_idsy_nb4_20260917.json`: all 25 rows, with CVCL_8821 at position 16 and CVCL_0005 at 21. The window is not full, so this fixture carries no note.
- `search_dr_ach_000362_20260917.json`, `search_dr_sidm00437_20260917.json`, `search_dr_chembl3706573_20260917.json`, and `search_dr_molm13_950_2019_20260917.json`: one row each, CVCL_2119.
- `get_cvcl_2119_20260917.json` and `get_cvcl_0064_20260917.json`: card fields plus `var` and `dr`.
- `get_cvcl_1844_var_20260917.json`: OCI-AML-3 card fields plus `var`.
- `get_cvcl_0007_20260917.json`: U-937 card fields plus `dr`, with no GDSC or Cosmic-CLP link.
- `get_cvcl_0005_20260917.json`: NB4 card fields plus `dr`.
- `release_info_20260917.json`: the `/release-info?format=json` body reporting release 56.0, 2026-06-25.

One synthetic 1000-row page is generated in the test from a template. It is not a recorded file. Extend `setup-provider-contract-spec-fixture.sh` to serve `/cellosaurus/...` from these files, answer an empty search for any other `ac:`, `dr:`, `idsy:`, or `id:` query, answer 404 for any other accession, and export `BIOMCP_CELLOSAURUS_BASE`. The server matches `/cell-line/{ac}` on the path alone and ignores the `fields` parameter, so each accession has one recorded file whatever projection the command asks for. A recorded file that lacks `var` is the empty-variants case, which acceptance 17 needs and no live record provides. An empty window is a normal zero-row result and never a Cellosaurus failure. Ticket 1213 relies on the same rule for its `id:` batches.

## Acceptance

Rust tests, fixture-backed, no live network:

1. Normalizer: `MOLM13`, `molm-13`, and `Molm 13` normalize equal. `MV4;11`, `MV4-11`, and `MV 4;11` normalize equal.
2. `MOLM13`, `MOLM-13`, and `MV4;11` searches each return the expected accession as the first row with `match: exact`. The `MOLM-13` search sends both `idsy:"MOLM-13"` and `idsy:"MOLM13"`, each answered by its own fixture, and merges them by accession into one row.
3. `KG1` returns the exact set {CVCL_0374, CVCL_E3VV, CVCL_UD72}, each with its species. CVCL_0374 is first because it is a human identifier match. The test checks the set and the first row, not the order of the rest. `KG-1` runs two requests and merges them by accession with no duplicate rows.
4. `NB4` returns CVCL_0005 first with `matched_on: name`. CVCL_8821 appears later with `matched_on: synonym`.
5. A full 1000-row window sets the total to unknown and prints the note. A 3-row window reports total 3 and no note.
6. The search request escapes `"` and `\` and targets `idsy:`. `CVCL_2119` as a query targets `ac:` instead.
7. `get cell-line CVCL_2119` parses accession, RRID `RRID:CVCL_2119`, name `MOLM-13`, synonyms, species 9606, NCIt disease C8263, category `Cancer cell line`, and sex `Male`. The card request has no `dr` in `fields`. The `xrefs` section lists DepMap `ACH-000362`, adds `dr` to the request, and leaves out the `Cosmic` sample rows.
8. `get cell-line CVCL_0064 xrefs` lists DepMap `ACH-000045`, COSMIC cell line `908156`, and ChEMBL `CHEMBL3308063`. `get cell-line CVCL_0007 xrefs` prints every key, with `gdsc` and `cosmic_clp` as empty lists.
9. `get cell-line CVCL_1844 variants` lists DNMT3A, NPM1, and NRAS rows with their HGVS descriptions as published.
10. `get cell-line ACH-000362`, `SIDM00437`, `CHEMBL3706573`, and `MOLM13_950_2019` each resolve to CVCL_2119. An unmatched source ID fails with the not-found error and the search hint.
11. An unknown accession fails with the not-found error. An unknown section fails before any request.
12. The catalog lists `cell-line` as searchable and gettable with sections `variants`, `xrefs`, and `all`. The typed MCP `get` schema gains a `cell-line` branch. Typed MCP `search` still rejects `cell-line`. The MCP shell allows `search cell-line` and `get cell-line` through the raw tool.
13. The health catalog test counts the new Cellosaurus row. The rate-limit test resolves Cellosaurus URLs to the new policy.
14. A `/release-info` fixture gives `data_as_of` `56.0 (2026-06-25)` and `data_as_of_kind: "release"` on every search and get output. A failing `/release-info` gives a retrieval time and `data_as_of_kind: "retrieved"`, and the rest of the output is unchanged.
15. Every Markdown output ends with the attribution line naming the release, CC BY 4.0, and the citation.
16. An HTML body served with HTTP 200 for a Cellosaurus JSON request is a provider error naming the URL, and no row renders.
17. `_meta.section_sources` names Cellosaurus for `variants` and `xrefs`. `get cell-line CVCL_0007 variants` replays `get_cvcl_0007_20260917.json`, which was recorded without `var`, so it completes `variants` as `empty`. `get cell-line CVCL_1844 variants` completes it as `data`. The entity has a `section_sources` builder in `src/render/provenance.rs`, beside the existing per-entity builders.

Executable spec `spec/entity/cell-line.md`, added to `SPEC_ROUTINE_PATHS`:

- `search cell-line "MV4;11"` Markdown shows a table row with `CVCL_0064`, `MV4-11`, and `exact`.
- `search cell-line KG1 --json` has three `exact` results and `results[0].accession == "CVCL_0374"`.
- `search cell-line NB4 --json` has `results[0].accession == "CVCL_0005"`.
- `get cell-line ACH-000362 --json` has `accession == "CVCL_2119"`.
- `get cell-line CVCL_2119 --json` has `accession == "CVCL_2119"`.
- `get cell-line CVCL_2119 xrefs --json` has `xrefs.depmap == ["ACH-000362"]`. The card request carries no `dr`, so the assertion needs the section.
- `get cell-line CVCL_2119` Markdown shows the attribution line and the `get cell-line CVCL_2119 xrefs` next command.
- `get cell-line CVCL_1844 variants` Markdown shows a variants table with `NPM1`.

`make lint`, `make test`, and `make spec` pass on the gate host at the pushed SHA.

## Decisions

These choices follow the 2026-09-17 source survey. Ian can overturn any of them.

- Cellosaurus is the identity source for every cell line section. Every other source joins to it through the CVCL accession.
- `data_as_of` is read from `/release-info` at runtime rather than pinned in the source, so a new Cellosaurus release needs no code change. A failed read degrades to the retrieval time instead of failing the command.
- Ranking puts identifier matches before synonym-only matches and human lines before other species. Upstream order failed on NB4.
- The card never fetches `dr`. Only `xrefs` and join sections pay for it.
- Sources read in other tickets: PharmacoDB (1205), DepMap through Figshare (1206), HPA expression across cell lines (1213), and ChEMBL cell line lookup (1214).
- Sources skipped, one reason each:
  - Cell Model Passports: it repeats Cellosaurus and DepMap, several calls timed out at 60 s, and it has no drug endpoint.
  - GDSC direct: the site returns 410, the bulk files are 2023 spreadsheets, and PharmacoDB carries GDSC1 and GDSC2.
  - CellMiner: it covers 60 lines by name with no accession, and it carries the HL-60(TB) name trap. PharmacoDB carries NCI60.
  - COSMIC Cell Lines: it needs an account, and commercial users go to Qiagen.
  - LINCS/CLUE: the API needs a user key. The card still lists the `LINCS_LDP` link.
  - ENCODE: its records are assay samples, not cell line facts.

## Out of scope

- Pivots such as `cell-line datasets`. Drug response and dependency sections are tickets 1205 and 1206.
- STR profiles, HLA typing, child lines, publications, and every other record field not named above.
- A species or disease filter on search, and any rule that picks one line among several exact matches and hides the rest.
- The `misspelling` field, fuzzy matching, and paging past the 1000-row window.
- Typed MCP `search` support, batch support, and local mirroring of Cellosaurus.


## Review

- Design review: ACCEPT 2026-09-17, `sdlc/planning/notes/2026-09-17-cell-line-1202-design-review.md`. All four blocking findings and the seven polish items are applied.
- Code review: record not kept at the time (the review process before ticket 1219 recorded no verdict; the work landed without one)
- Verification: shipped in the 0.8.x series (no gate record was kept before ticket 1219 introduced records); see CHANGELOG and git history
