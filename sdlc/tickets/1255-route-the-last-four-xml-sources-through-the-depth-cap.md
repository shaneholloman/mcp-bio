# Route the last four XML sources through the depth cap

From the 2026-09-27 review file (Product, first bullet). Ticket 1243
put a pre-parse nesting cap in `parse_external_xml` and proved the
bomb against it, but four upstream sources still call
`roxmltree::Document::parse` directly, so deep input on those paths
can still overflow the parser stack. Ian confirmed this himself.

## Problem

- `src/sources/vaers.rs:329` — direct `Document::parse`
- `src/sources/hpa.rs:434` — direct `Document::parse`
- `src/sources/medlineplus.rs:185` — direct `Document::parse`
- `src/sources/pmc_oa.rs:227` — direct `Document::parse`
- `src/sources/vaers/tests/mod.rs:22` — a test helper parses a
  request fixture directly; route it too or scope the guard so the
  choice is deliberate, not accidental.

## Fix

1. Route all four production sites through
   `crate::xml::parse_external_xml`. Preserve each site's current
   error mapping quality: the depth-cap rejection
   (`DepthLimitExceeded`) must surface as the same error type the
   site already uses (`BioMcpError::Api` wording or the site's
   existing degrade arm), never as a panic or a generic loss.
2. Add a repository guard test that fails on any direct
   `Document::parse` outside `src/xml.rs`. Structural, not a phrase
   ban: scan tracked `.rs` files under `src/` for the call form
   (allowing the one inside `src/xml.rs`), so renames, aliases, and
   new files are all covered. A test of the checker itself must
   plant a direct call in a scratch file and see the checker catch
   it, and must show the checker ignoring a comment that merely
   mentions the call.

## Acceptance

- The guard test passes on the fixed tree and fails when any one of
  the four sites is reverted (prove one red run per revert in the
  commit message or the record; one representative revert proof is
  enough if the four are mechanically identical).
- The checker's own test proves it catches a planted direct call in
  a file it did not know about.
- Each of the four sources has a depth-bomb rejection test in its
  own test module (a >64-deep fixture through the source's parse
  entry point, asserting the honest error, not a panic).
- Yellow gate green (lint, test, spec, stress).

## Out of scope

- Changing the cap value or the scan algorithm (1243 territory,
  already recorded).
