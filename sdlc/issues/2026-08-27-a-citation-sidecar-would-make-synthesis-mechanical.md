# A citation sidecar would make synthesis mechanical

Found in a botassembly knowledge-base run (2026-08-27): the synthesize
stage had to scrape evidence URLs and database attributions out of
rendered markdown to cite its knowledge-base files. It worked, but the mapping from claim to source
lives only in the prose layer — JSON output carries `_meta.evidence_urls`,
yet a consumer writing cited documents must reconcile markdown prose
against a separate JSON call.

The idea: a `--cite` flag (or a per-output sidecar file) that returns, for
one command's output, the structured citation set — upstream records with
labels and URLs, the section sources, and the identifiers used — so an
agent or script can render citations mechanically instead of pattern-
matching prose. Nothing about default output changes.

Not validated as a requirement by anyone outside our own experiments yet;
recorded for triage.

## Decision (ticket 1238, 2026-09-26)

Stays open for 1.0 triage: an unvalidated idea with no consumer
outside our own experiments. If the 1.0 knowledge-base work wants
mechanical citations, this is its design seed.
