# GenCC store deadline expires under full-suite load on slower machines

Observed 2026-09-12 while running the full `make test` gate for ticket 1163 on
yellow.local (4 cores, 15 GB RAM, Ubuntu 25.10), the first full-suite run of
this branch on hardware slower than the 16-core dev box.

`entities::gene::gencc::tests::subprocess_lease_defers_old_generation_cleanup_until_reader_exits`
failed with `Err(Deadline)` unwrapped in the `publish` helper
(`src/entities/gene/gencc/tests.rs:468`). The run cancelled early under the
configured fail-fast, stopping at 1,478 of 3,452 tests with this as the only
failure.

The deadline is a fixed two seconds of wall clock. `Store::open()` calls
`open_until(Instant::now() + Duration::from_secs(2))`
(`src/sources/gencc/store.rs:111`), and `ensure_deadline` guards every step of
the publish pipeline, not just lock acquisition. During the failing run,
neighboring GenCC tests in the same suite took 10 to 27 seconds each under
four-way test parallelism, so the two-second budget can expire from external
CPU and fsync contention alone.

A second full-suite run the same morning failed the same way at 1,457 of
3,452 tests with 1,455 passed. Both failures were GenCC tests sharing this
root cause:

- `crash_boundaries_preserve_one_complete_namespace_generation` panicked at
  `tests.rs:468` on `Err(Deadline)` in the `publish` helper.
- `cleanup_faults_retain_unowned_or_unfinished_entries_for_a_later_pass`
  panicked at `tests.rs:844`: the store deadline expired before its second
  cleanup pass, and the assertion then found the retained entry that the
  deferred pass should have removed.

Evidence it is load-dependent rather than a data or logic bug:

- The test passes solo on yellow, three consecutive runs, 0.034 s each.
- The test passes solo on the 16-core dev box, 0.26 s.
- No assertion about generations or leases failed; only the deadline did.

Worth considering: whether the deadline should bound only lock acquisition
instead of total publish duration, whether tests should scale or override the
budget via an environment variable, and whether the fail-fast cancellation
should be relaxed for known machine-sensitive tests. A full `make test` on a
4-core host cannot currently complete the gate while this budget is fixed.

This is not only a test-portability problem. `Store::open` runs in the
production refresh path, and the same budget exhaustion can abort a real
refresh on a loaded or slow-disk host. Preferred direction: bound lock
acquisition with the deadline and let filesystem work proceed once the lock
is held; add a separate operation deadline only if the product needs one.
Test-side deadline scaling would hide that production behavior.

## Decision (ticket 1238, 2026-09-26)

Subsumed as a watch item: the deadline family it belonged to was
replaced by signal waits (1239, 1247, 1252), the publish helper's
deadline now scales with the test timeout factor, and the stress
lane watches the family. Reopen only on a recurrence.
