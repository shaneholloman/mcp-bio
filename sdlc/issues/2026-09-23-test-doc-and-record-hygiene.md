# Test, doc, and record hygiene

Filed 2026-09-23 from an independent review of `v0.9.0..f2549676`.

## Tests

- `tests/test_source_licensing_docs_contract.py:204` fails once a `reviewed_on` date passes 365 days. The oldest is 2026-03-20, so `make test` goes red on every branch around 2027-03-20 with no code change. Move it to a scheduled check or a warning.
- `src/cache/migration.rs:862-892` (ticket 1228): the `untouched` and marker checks cannot fail because the operation never touches disk. Set a flag after the operation's yield and assert it after `io.await`.
- `tests/test_article_spec_fixture_lifecycle.py:813` asserts a substring of the line above it.
- `src/sources/cellosaurus/tests.rs:19` repeats what the exact URL check before it proves.
- `tests/test_documentation_consistency_audit_contract.py`: the hand-copied catalog pattern misses the blog's count form ("21,701 UTF-8 bytes and 5,599 `cl100k_base` tokens").

## clingen-cspec spec flake

Seen once under load during a gate. Likely causes, unconfirmed:

- `setup-clingen-cspec-spec-fixture.sh` waits 5 seconds for its server (`seq 1 50` at 0.1s).
- The driver runs about 25 CLI calls and two `uv run` starts inside a 180-second block limit.
- The exact request-log check breaks if the client retry fires.

Allow about 30 seconds for readiness and print `server.log` and the report JSON on failure.

## CI

"Record exact tool versions" does not print `bwrap`, `apparmor_parser`, or `rg` versions. The apt install omits `-y` and relies on the runner's assume-yes setting. Add both.

## Architecture doc

- `architecture/technical/overview.md:10` says the advertised MCP tool is `biomcp`. The server advertises seven tools.
- `:291` says CI installs exact tool versions. Ticket 1220 unpinned them.
- The 1224 record says 1222 owns the architecture facts. 1227 took them over.

## Records

- The review residuals from 1219, 1221, 1222, 1224, 1225, 1226, and 1229 live only in record prose. File each open one here or gate it.
- `sdlc/issues/` holds three near-duplicate 2026-09-13 files about the raw-ctgov-total abort on the gate host. Merge them.
- The 1222 record and ticket file names differ.

## Resolved

Ticket 1244. Every listed item except the ctgov merge landed at the
time (the three near-duplicate 2026-09-13 raw-ctgov-total files were
merged 2026-09-26 by ticket 1254 batch 2, not at landing; the
canonical file now carries the full root-cause and frame-table
history): the staleness check warns instead
of failing, the migration test asserts the settle flag, the three test
weaknesses are fixed, the audit bans the count form off the blog, the
cspec fixture waits 30s and prints diagnostics, CI records the three
tool versions and installs with -y, the overview names seven tools and
the true pinning state, the residuals have recorded dispositions, and
the 1222 record file was renamed. Deliberately open: the cspec block
limit and retry/request-log items. The freshness warning was
deliberately unenforced at 1244; since ticket 1254 batch 2
(2026-09-26) the check warns at 300 days and fails the gate past 365.
